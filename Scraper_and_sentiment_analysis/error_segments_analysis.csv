5," worked to create a 3-billion parameter model as part of Apple Intelligence. ChatGPT’s GPT-3 model from 2020, in comparison, is much larger, at 175 billion parameters. The more parameters, the more memory and computing power needed to run the model. Apple’s approach is faster than the cloud-based options and has privacy benefits. However, there can be issues when the models are too small to get anything done. Apple is betting that through a user’s iPhone, its AI can tap into personal data about appointments, location, and what the user is doing. One example provided by Federighi is that his phone knows who his daughter is. Apple also says it’s making sure its small models work only on tasks they can excel at, rather than give users an open-ended chatbot interface. “There’s a critical extra step, which is we’re not taking this teenager and telling him to go fly an airplane,” Federighi said. Many AI features Apple announced on Monday are similar to products already announced this year. Apple’s AI can summarize and rewrite documents, generate small images, and translate conversations in real time. One notable feature will enable users to generate new emojis using AI without connecting to the internet. The new features will be released this fall in a beta version. Privacy will be a challenge for Apple as it embraces AI. It has used privacy as one of its primary marketing tools for years, highlighting that Apple’s business model doesn’t require ad targeting and that it has the best interests of its users in mind versus data brokers and spammers. Other AI companies collect user data and store it to improve their software, a practice that doesn’t fit Apple’s current privacy policies. Much of Apple’s presentation on Monday pointed to steps the company has taken to prevent the impression that it’s hoovering up user data to improve its AI. “We’re not going to take that data and go send it to some cloud somewhere,” Giannandrea said. “Because we want everything to be very private, whether it’s running locally or on a cloud computing service, and that’s the way we want it so we can use your most personal data.” Apple didn’t detail what data was used to train its AI models, beyond that it uses files scraped from the public web in",error,513

18,", Giannandrea’s team has worked on AI features that run behind the scenes on Apple devices and software. That includes things such as an accessibility feature that can digitally mimic someone’s voice if they lose the ability to speak themselves, and automatic edits that make your iPhone photos look better. If you ask the folks at Apple, the company has been using AI for many years to power what you do on your Apple devices without you even knowing about it. That’s expected to evolve into more user-facing features this year, such as improvements to Siri, a partnership with OpenAI that’ll add the ChatGPT-maker’s tech to the iPhone’s software, and sophisticated voice controls for its apps, according to a Bloomberg report last week. People who have worked with Giannandrea over the years who spoke to CNBC characterize him as a humble, mild-mannered technologist who doesn’t seek attention like more flashy Silicon Valley executives typically do. His most notable start was at a company called General Magic, which spun out of Apple and began business in the early 1990s making software for PDAs, the predecessors to today’s modern smartphones. Late in that decade he cofounded TellMe, a startup that made a voice-activated, online information service. A TellMe cofounder, Anthony Accardi, said Giannandrea always seemed ahead of his time, working on technology such as running software in the cloud many years before it became the standard. “He has the foresight to recognize this is an inevitability and direction we’re going in the future,” Accardi said. Giannandrea, known by most as “JG,” joined Google after the search giant acquired another startup he cofounded called Metaweb. Geoffrey Hinton, known as one of the “godfathers” of AI, worked with Giannandrea at Google. Hinton said Giannandrea had a rare skill set among tech executives as both a great researcher and manager. Hinton pointed to a generative AI breakthrough Google made last decade: the ability to automatically caption images using AI. “He really understood the importance of it,” Hinton said. By 2018, Giannandrea oversaw AI at Google, and it was seen as a huge coup when Apple poached him that year. Within eight months, he was promoted to Apple’s leadership team, reporting directly to Cook along",error,513
18," with other top executives such as Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and services boss Eddy Cue. It was the biggest sign yet that Apple was taking AI seriously, especially for future projects like its now-defunct self-driving car project. So why leave Google, the perceived leader in AI at the time, for Apple? He didn’t like how leadership at Google had trouble making decisions and executing them, instead treating parts of the business like a skunkworks research lab, according to one person who spoke with Giannandrea recently. He found the opposite at Apple: leadership makes a decision, and then the rest of the company gets behind it to make it happen. But in the six years since joining Apple, Giannandrea hasn’t been in the public view like his peers on Apple’s leadership team often are, showing off the company’s latest products and updates in flashy promotional videos littered with slick edits and dad jokes. Yet his many years of experience and expertise have earned him wide respect among other Silicon Valley leaders. “I still go to him for wisdom,” said Emil Michael, a former top executive at Uber who also cofounded TellMe with Giannandrea. Outside of Apple, Giannandrea sits on the board of SETI, the nonprofit organization founded in 1984 to detect radio signals from potential intelligent life across the cosmos. He also ran a data center business with his wife in recent years, which he eventually sold, adding to his list of successful exits at tech companies he cofounded. At SETI, Giannandrea is an active and engaged board member, and even gave some of his own money to help fund a new project called COSMIC that uses powerful computers to analyze radio signals from outer space, SETI CEO Bill Diamond told CNBC. Giannandrea also sat on a SETI review committee to give feedback on research plans for planetary defenses against asteroids, according to Diamond. “He’s got a very scientific mind, an engineering mind,” Diamond said. “The question about life beyond Earth fascinates him.” Some who know Giannandrea told CNBC they’d be surprised if he made an appearance during Apple’s WWDC keynote Monday, instead of delegating the spotlight to members of his team or Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software. “JG is not a showman,” one person who knows him well told CNBC. “That�",error,513
19," Taking the stage will be executives including software chief Craig Federighi, who will likely address the real-life uses of Apple’s AI, whether it should be run locally or in massive cloud clusters and what should be built into the operating system versus distributed in an app. Privacy is also a key issue, and attendees will likely want to know how Apple can deploy the data-hungry technology without compromising user privacy, a centerpiece of the company’s marketing for over half a decade. “At WWDC, we expect Apple to unveil its long-term vision around its implementation of generative AI throughout its diverse ecosystem of personal devices,” wrote Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in a note this week. “We believe that the impact of generative AI to Apple’s business is one of the most profound in all of technology, and unlike much of the innovation in AI that’s impacting the developer or enterprise, Apple has a clear opportunity to reach billions of consumer devices with generative AI functionality.” Last month, OpenAI revealed a voice mode for its AI software called ChatGPT-4o. In a short demo, OpenAI researchers held an iPhone and spoke directly to the bot inside the ChatGPT app, which was able to do impressions, speak fluidly and even sing. The conversation was snappy, the bot gave advice and the voice sounded like a human. Further demos at the live event showed the bot singing, teaching trigonometry, translating and telling jokes. Apple users and pundits immediately understood that OpenAI had demoed a preview of what Apple’s Siri could be in the future. Apple’s voice assistant debuted in 2011 and since has gained a reputation for not being useful. It’s rigid, only able to answer a small proportion of well-defined queries, partially because it’s based on older machine learning techniques. Apple could team up with OpenAI to upgrade Siri next week. It’s been discussing licensing chatbot technology from other companies, too, including Google and Cohere, according to a report from The New York Times. Apple declined to comment on an OpenAI partnership. One possibility is that Apple’s new Siri won’t compete directly with fully featured chatbots, but will improve its current features, and toss off queries that can only be answered by a chatbot to a partner. It’s close to how Apple’s Spotlight search and Siri",error,513
19," work now. Apple’s system tries to answer the question, but if it can’t, it turns to Google. That agreement is part of a deal worth $18 billion per year to Apple. Apple might also shy away from a full-throated embrace of an OpenAI partnership or chatbot. One reason is that a malfunctioning chatbot could generate embarrassing headlines, and could undermine the company’s emphasis on user privacy and personal control of user data. “Data security will be a key advantage for the company and we expect them to spend time talking about their privacy efforts during the WWDC as well,” Citi analyst Atif Malik said in a recent note. OpenAI’s technology is based on web scraping, and ChatGPT user interactions are used to improve the model itself, a technique that could violate some of Apple’s privacy principles. Large language models like OpenAI’s still have problems with inaccuracies or “hallucinations,” like when Google’s search AI said last month that President Barack Obama was the first Muslim president. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently found himself in the middle of a thorny societal debate about deepfakes and deception when he denied accusations from actress Scarlett Johansson that OpenAI’s voice mode had ripped off her voice. It’s the kind of conflict that Apple executives prefer to avoid. Outside of Apple, AI has become reliant on big server farms using powerful Nvidia processors paired with terabytes of memory to crunch numbers. Apple, by contrast, wants its AI features to run on iPhones, and iPads, and Macs, which operate on battery power. Cook has highlighted Apple’s own chips as superior for running AI models. “We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple Silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy,” Cook told investors in May on an earnings call. Samik Chatterjee, an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a note this month that, “We expect Apple’s presentation at WWDC keynote to be focused on the features and the on-device capabilities as well as the GenAI models being run on-device to enable those features.” In April, Apple published research about AI models it calls “efficient",error,513
19," language models” that would be able to run on a phone. Microsoft is also publishing research on the same concept. One of Apple’s “OpenELM” models has 1.1 billion parameters, or weights — far smaller than OpenAI’s 2020 GPT-3 model which has 175 billion parameters, and smaller even than the 70 billion parameters in one version of Meta’s Llama, which is one of the most widely used language models. In the paper, Apple’s researchers benchmarked the model on a MacBook Pro laptop running Apple’s M2 Max chip, showing that these efficient models don’t necessarily need to connect to the cloud. That can improve response speed, and provide a layer of privacy, because sensitive questions could be answered on the device itself, rather than being sent back to Apple servers. Some of the features built into Apple’s software could include providing users a summary of their missed text messages, image generation for new emojis, code completing in the company’s development software Xcode, or drafting email responses, according to Bloomberg. Apple could also decide to load up its M2 Ultra chips in its data centers to process AI queries that need more horsepower, Bloomberg reported. WWDC won’t strictly be about AI. The company has more than 2.2 billion devices in use, and customers want improved software and new apps. One potential upgrade could be Apple’s adoption of RCS, an improvement to the older system of text messaging known as SMS. Apple’s messages app diverts texts between iPhones to its own iMessage system, which displays conversations as blue bubbles. When an iPhone texts an Android phone, the bubble is green. Many features such as typing notifications aren’t available. Google led development of RCS, adding encryption and other features to text messaging. Late last year Apple confirmed that it would add support for RCS alongside iMessage. The debut of iOS 18 would be the logical time to show its work. The conference will also be the first anniversary of Apple’s reveal of the Vision Pro, its virtual and augmented reality headset, which was released in the U.S. in February. Apple could announce its expansion to more countries, including China and the U.K. Apple said in its WWDC announcement that the Vision Pro would be in the spotlight. Vision Pro is currently on the first version of its operating system, and core features, such as its Persona videoconf",error,513

It used to be on the top of the iPad, forcing that awkward glance to the side during video calls. The quality was nice and clear during my tests, and I like that the camera, using the Center Stage feature, followed me as I moved around the room. The iPad has the latest and greatest M4 chip, which hasn’t launched on Macs yet. I ran a GeekBench multicore benchmark test that shows it scoring 48% higher than the prior M2 iPad Pro. Apple promises up to 4x faster rendering over the M2 and 1.5x faster processor performance, which means video editing in Final Cut Pro for iPad and rendering things like 3D models is quicker for professionals who need it. The M4 also has a special engine that helps power the “Tandem OLED” displays. Apple took a unique approach to the iPad by stacking two OLED screens on top of one another, which requires this special part of the M4 chip to work. The iPad Pro felt quick when I ran two apps side by side, switching between Slack and the web browser, or loading into games. Apps switch in an instant. It wasn’t much different from my M1 iPad for everyday stuff, like browsing the web and opening apps, which seems to be how iPads are mostly used. More on that in the next section. The new iPad Pros support Apple’s updated $350 Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro (the 11-inch version is $300). It’s awesome and is just like typing on a Mac with a full function row above the number keys to switch apps, adjust the volume or brightness and more. Apple added a much larger trackpad and an aluminum palm rest but kept the same soft outside and “floating” screen mechanism, which allows you to snap the iPad onto the case using its magnetic pins and tilt it back and forth. The updated Apple Pencil Pro is also a lot of fun. I mostly use the Apple Pencil to sign documents. But folks who draw or paint on their iPads, or need more control in 3D or video apps, will like the new features. I liked squeezing it to change between the tool — pencil or brush or eraser and the color — and the haptic pulse to confirm you’ve squeezed it. Developers can add the squeeze function to their apps",error,513
26," so you can access different tools in different apps. The added gyroscope also allows you to tilt and twirl the pencil to change your pencil or pen stroke. Double tap is convenient, too, allowing you to switch between a pencil and eraser tool, for example. The hover function previews where you’re going to touch the display. Apple promises the same battery life as the last iPad Pros. So you get about 10 hours of web browsing or watching video, or nine hours if you’re browsing the web on a cellular connection. That lined up with what I received during my tests. Expect to get a full workday of use. Still, it’s impressive given this iPad is 1.3mm thinner and 103 grams lighter than the last 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Here’s my biggest gripe about the Pro models: The software, iPadOS, is what you’ll get on any other iPad. And while I think it works great, it’s time for the Pro models to have a better operating system. My guess is Apple has something big planned for next month’s Worldwide Developers Conference, and I hope it addresses this. I probably won’t get my wish, but I’d love to see the iPad Pro act just like a Mac. Plop it into the keyboard and it turns into a touchscreen MacBook. Lift it off and use it like a regular iPad. It has a newer processor than Apple’s MacBooks, so this should be possible if it’s something Apple wants. Regardless, we need better multitasking. Apple’s “Stage Manager” feature was supposed to make it easier to run multiple apps and switch between them, but it’s still too confusing and clunky. Apps should open in separate windows and minimize just like on a Mac. And, since the M-series processors also power Macs, we should be able to run Mac apps, too. Apple talked a lot about artificial intelligence when it announced the new iPads. But, most of the AI is what Apple has previously called machine learning. A lot of that stuff happens behind the scenes. The camera can take multiple pictures of a document and scan it more accurately, for example. AI can isolate backgrounds in Final Cut Pro or generate music in apps such as StaffPad. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he’ll talk about generative AI during WWDC in June, so there are likely more features coming. Last",error,513
34," loyalty, meaning that nine out of 10 current U.S. iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device. Buffett also has hailed Apple’s ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends, a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank. When the Apple CEO was asked in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments, Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett. “When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn’t have a bias?” Cook said. “So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he’s the natural person.” Apple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways. In 2019, the company published an original iPhone game called “Warren Buffett’s Paper Wizard” in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apple’s hometown of Cupertino, California. But with Apple’s business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low single-digit growth in the current quarter, Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat, particularly with regulatory pressures building around tech’s mega-cap companies. Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year, though only by about 1%. Even after Friday’s rally, the stock is down 3.8% in 2024, while the S&P 500 is up 7.5%. Berkshire’s initial foray into Apple in 2016 was not Buffett’s idea. Rather, the investment was led by Ted Weschler, one of his top deputies, and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers. But the following year, Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares, and Buffett began talking it up. He said he liked the stock and the company’s “sticky” product, although he didn’t use it. In 2018, he said Apple users are “very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally” to the product and the ecosystem. “Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,” he said. At last year’s annual meeting, when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up",error,513
34," so much of its public portfolio, Buffett said, “It just happens to be a better business than any we own.” He also hailed Cook, calling him one of the “best managers in the world.” A number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business, despite the declining revenue, is “2.2 billion.” That’s how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services. “Once customers get into the ecosystem, they don’t leave. So it’s not a speculative tech play,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Apple shares. “It’s kind of more like an annuity and I think that’s what Warren Buffett really sees as well.” In addition to the drop in revenue, Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets, as well as from Microsoft and Google’s advancements in artificial intelligence. For regulators, the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive, and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market. The U.S. government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in. The Department of Justice’s lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card, the Apple Arcade game subscription, iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone, creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when it’s time for an upgrade. However, the litigation is expected to take years, pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future. In the meantime, there’s no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences, while consumer AI products have failed to take off. Buffett hasn’t voiced his view publicly on Apple’s regulatory hurdles, and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJ’s lawsuit. But Buffett knows a little something about regulation — two markets where he’s most active are railroads and insurance. In a note to clients earlier this month, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn’t go deep on regulatory concerns, but mentioned that he doesn’t believe the DOJ suit will “seriously threaten” the strength of Apple’s ecosystem. He also",error,513
42,"% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models which were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.   Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% year over year to $7.9 billion.  During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3,500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.   “We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said.  Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.   Cook said that Apple has “big plans to announce” at its iPad product event next week and at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.   The company’s Services business was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. The company has a broad definition of subscribers, including users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store. It counts over 1 billion paid subscriptions.   Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $16.37 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries the iPhone maker may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.   “I feel good about China. I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said.  Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter, which “may come as a surprise to some people.”   In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25-cent dividend, a 1-cent increase.

50," that created disruption there, there were workers who sort of had to be quarantined and things like that. And then what followed was some unrest amongst some of the workers there as well. And that caused huge disruptions to production of iPhones out of the main place where the global — the world’s supply — of iPhones are assembled. And I think that got Apple thinking, we’ve been speaking a lot about Apple’s reliance on China and Apple reducing its reliance, which hadn’t really happened at all. But I think that moment, what it did was put scrutiny on Apple’s reliance on China as a manufacturing hub. It then also, I think, for the company, accelerated plans for the company to think where else can we diversify our supply chain? Where else can we manufacture our products so if there is any kind of disruption anywhere, that at least we know, we have supplies of these products and can rely on other places to ramp up production. And so I think that’s really what happened. It was the Covid era that sparked that. Some of those intense restrictions, I think, exposed how much reliance Apple actually had on China when it comes to this. I think one estimate put, at one point, I think China was producing something like 90% of the world’s iPhones. And so that gives you the idea of the kind of reliance Apple had on the country. Tom Chitty From Apple’s perspective as well. So I understand they’re de-risking maybe their supply chain, but the cost to move a supply chain or at least part of a supply chain from one country to another: different languages, not necessarily the historical manufacturing infrastructure in place to be able to support, you know, what China has been doing for several years, decades even is, is that worth the de-risking of the supply chain? Arjun Kharpal I think if you’re Apple, a company like Apple, with that many products, it is worth the risk, because what happens when there’s another event out of your control, or as we know, there’s these huge trade tensions that still exist between the U.S. and China? It could take an escalation of that to also hamper Apple’s ability to produce in China perhaps, ability to sell in China perhaps. So the way Apple is looking at it is well, you know, they’re not going to leave China.",error,513
50," You know, China is still the most important manufacturing hub for Apple. Yes, it has sort of slightly reduced its reliance on China. But it’s still a huge part and will be for the coming years. I think what you’re seeing though, is Apple invest more with its partners, the likes of Foxconn, as I mentioned in places like India, and Vietnam, as well. And we’ll speak a little bit about that later. But they’re looking at other areas and investing more in those areas. So that, you know, they can start to perhaps slowly reduce some of the production in China. But also, if you think about it have the ability to ramp up production elsewhere, let’s just say, there’s another issue in China, that disrupts production to the iPhone, but they’re also manufacturing in say, India, then they could potentially, if the factory has capacity, pick up that slack that was lost from China. So for Apple, you know, not being able to get the product to market will cost them billions of dollars of sales. You know, if they’re not able to get their iPhones and other things to market, no one’s gonna buy and people are going to wait, they will cost so it’s worth them spending the billions to then invest in other hubs. And I think that’s what’s what they’re doing. Tom Chitty For it to fully work though you would need other countries, whether it’s India, or Vietnam, we’re going to be talking about in a bit, they need to be able to do it from end to end, or at least fill those roles that China was doing, which, again, is not necessarily cost effective. Arjun Kharpal Yeah. And I think that’s why the ramp-up hasn’t been as aggressive or as easy as people thought. We’ve been speaking about this for years Apple’s sort of reliance on China, but not much had been done, because as you said, it’s a difficult process, you know, you can’t just shift and move away from China, as much as you know, India, and these other hubs are being spoken about, it’s not easy to just set up manufacturing, that takes a lot. Firstly, you know, it’s things like local regulations and",error,513
50," incentives and all of that, and making sure it’s worth the return on investment. But then it’s the expertise, it’s the actual workforce, who are able to do that. That’s a huge part of it. So when we talk about, you know, Apple manufacturing elsewhere, it’s going take a long time to significantly ramp up iPhone production elsewhere. And we’ve seen that in India so far. I mean, so far, India, apparently, according to a recent Bloomberg report, now produces one in seven iPhones, or around 14% of total global iPhones. And that was double the last fiscal year, that’s aggressive. But you are you are seeing it happen. But the question is, how much can India take on and how quickly so, you know, it’s early stages yet. So you know, perhaps they’ve got the capacity. But do they have enough to scale to the level China is. And the other point here is, you know, Apple’s not going to want to recreate its reliance on any one country. Again, the whole point of trying to reduce reliance on China is to have a diversified supply chain. So, you know, they’re not going to say, oh, we want you know, 60% of iPhones to be produced in India. Now. I doubt it. One minister, last year, was suggesting that Apple had said that, ultimately, they want about 25% of iPhones, as you said in your intro, by 2030 produced in India, which, you know, you feel like a quarter of the world’s iPhones, you know, that could be important, you know, some of those are going to be sold in India, which is important, local manufacturing. We did that episode talking about India’s desire to become the sort of high-tech manufacturing hub of Asia. Apple’s efforts here are part of that and part of the government’s incentives to bring in foreign companies. So that’s also what’s happening here. And so you know, they want that manufacturing in India, those products will be sold to Indians, but also exported, as well. And so you’re starting to see, I think the early signs of what Apple can do and its partners can do in terms of setting up manufacturing in India. But as you mentioned, I don’t think this is something",error,513
50," now that’s going to happen, or be equivalent to China, anytime soon. Tom Chitty A couple of weeks ago, you mentioned we talked about India as a tech hub, or a future tech hub, we had, let’s say, a fair bit of skepticism from listeners in India about whether it could legitimately step in and, you know, replace some of what China has been doing. You did say at the end of that episode, that, you know, we’re still a long way from India, being in that place. So just to give us a little bit more context to what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago. Arjun Kharpal As you mentioned, we did we did address some of those concerns. You know, we were talking a bit about what India is trying to do now, the groundwork is trying to lay to try to rival China in Asia as a manufacturing hub, a high-tech manufacturing hub, just to be clear, it’s nowhere near China at this point, you know, that that’s, that’s pretty clear and evident at this point. There’s a lot of challenges that remain in India, I think we’ve we’ve talked about some of them here. Those include, you know, expertise and workforce, to do some of this manufacturing, particularly in areas like semiconductors, which is highly, highly specialized, you know, also the workforce to be assembling these iPhones need to be trained, etc. in the country, you know, that takes a bit of time as well, and other electronics. There’s also complaints around still some of the red tape, bureaucracy that remains, some of the rules, all of these kinds of things at this point, are challenges for the India market, as well as of course, you know, ensuring that there is trust in the political system, to some extent, as well. So there’s all of these challenges, I think India has to deal with now, to turn itself into a serious rival to China. And not only that, I mean, India is not the only rival to China. Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, all of these places are vying to try to... as global electronics companies, not just Apple, but global electronics companies looking to diversify their supply chains to other parts, Southeast Asia generally, are going to be big beneficiaries. And you’ve already seen other countries also. So India is",error,513
50," not only trying to sort of rival China in that extent. There’s other countries that are also vying for that position and competition, which are directly also competing with India. And so it’s a really interesting dynamic at play here. And so, yeah, it’s clear India is nowhere near China at this point in terms of its ability to be a manufacturing, high-tech hub yet, but what we were talking about is what kind of groundwork they’re laying the way that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi is talking to all of these foreign companies, including Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and many of the other electronics makers as well as semiconductor players to woo them to set up shop in India. And the promise of India, of course, is not only on the manufacturing side, it’s that massive population. Tom Chitty Yeah, I want to get into that, because that’s a huge part of this. In India, what are the most popular phone brands? Arjun Kharpal It’s Samsung, it’s Xiaomi. It’s Oppo. So it’s the Chinese brands and Samsung. Tom Chitty Huawei? Arjun Kharpal Huawei, not so much because they’ve had a lot of problems on the international market. But at one point, they were doing very, very well before U.S. sanctions, you know, crippled their, their smartphone business. But the Indian smartphone market thus far has been dominated by some low to mid-priced smartphones, right? You know, mainly Android phones. But what you’re seeing now, and this is again, why the India market in particular is becoming quite crucial, I think, to Apple and Tim Cook’s thinking about where to target is the massive population, what is it 1.4 billion or so people there, but it’s showing some of the similar dynamics to what China showed a few years ago, a growing middle class getting wealthier, willing to spend on technology, particularly in the big cities, the likes of Mumbai, the likes of New Delhi where they’ve opened actually their first Apple Stores last year. And you know, opening a physical Apple store often for Apple is a sign of a big deal. It’s a market they want to target first Apple stores in 2023 gives you a sense of what Apple is looking at when it looks in India. Yes, the manufacturing is important. Yes",error,513
50,". It’s going to be a key hub for manufacturing for iPhones, but actually the consumer is what interests Apple a lot now. And the fact that they’re that the high-end part of the smartphone market is growing in India, that’s where Apple targets and coinciding with these stores, with the increased manufacturing, you see a lot of effort going into this market. Just to give you a sort of sense right now, I spoke earlier about the amount of iPhones being produced right now in India. Sales, so first stores last year. In the second quarter of last year, India, for the first time became one of Apple’s top five markets for sales. So, you know, it’s then competing with the U.S. and other countries now. So it’s in top five. In the market, Apple only has about 7% market share. At the moment, it’s behind Samsung, it’s behind Xiaomi is behind Oppo these big, you know, Android vendors. So it’s still very early days in terms of sales for Apple. But again, it’s part of laying the groundwork for what it hopes will become its next China. Tom Chitty I mean, it’s a huge area of growth, isn’t it? You know, we’ve talked for years about the sort of stagnating growth in the smartphone market in Europe in the U.S. But you know, Apple looking at India going, wow, we’ve only got 7% of market share there, we could grow huge amounts. And whilst also doing these other things with the supply chain, I mean, it’s a win-win in many respects. Arjun Kharpal Yeah. And that’s part of it. One of the things Apple’s done very successfully over the years is the way that it showed itself, or billed itself as a high-end premium luxury brand in the smartphone market. And when you look at the sort of Indian consumer, and like I said, sort of that growing middle class, that’s what they want premium luxury devices, premium luxury products. And this is where Apple has an opportunity now. And of course, as we know, with Apple, the hardware is the, you know, one side of the equation, but also, you know, Apple makes billions of dollars off of its services business, which includes things like",error,513
50," its App Store fees, it’s Apple Pay, Apple TV, all of those other products and services. So when you know it’s going into these markets, it’s not just thinking about the iPhone, it’s thinking about its services business as well to the consumers there, and how it might localize some of that, but also all the other products as well as the Apple Watch, and the Mac books, etc. And so this is why I think India stands out as a market for Apple versus other countries in Southeast Asia because of some of these dynamics that are happening, which I think Apple feels, is where we can really have a significant market in the future. But again, not very soon. Tom Chitty So, for the likes of Vietnam, who we mentioned earlier, they’re going to be competing against that, right? That’s the problem that Vietnam faces where, you know, this market that India has is huge, a burgeoning middle class that want and can afford a premium product like an iPhone. How can Vietnam challenge that when it comes to attracting Apple to make more of the components or at least some of the components in Vietnam? Arjun Kharpal Vietnam is fascinating, I was writing about it today. Actually, as we’re recording this Apple CEO, Tim Cook is right now in Hanoi, Vietnam. He had an egg coffee. I’ve been to Vietnam before. Haven’t ever sampled an egg coffee. I believe, and perhaps if we have any listeners in Vietnam, they can correct me on this, but I think it’s a Hanoi specialty. And it’s sort of made with coffee, condensed milk, and like, whipped egg, sounds really good. Like that’s a breakfast in a cup. Yeah. You know? Tom Chitty Yeah, I was just imagining the whipped egg like an eggnog. Arjun Kharpal I think it’s something like that again. I haven’t had it so I can’t attest to how and I’d love to try it. Yeah, it sounds absolutely fantastic. And Vietnamese coffee is really strong and bold, nice. So I reckon it tastes amazing. But so he enjoyed one of those. Apparently, he’s meeting with content creators, developers, etc. As he goes around the country, but I think when Tim Cook goes somewhere, it’s often",error,513
50," a sign of Apple’s commitment to that country. He’s been over the past year or two to India to China to Vietnam now. Gives you a sense I think, where the company’s focus is. Vietnam has been very impressive so far in billing itself as a key manufacturing hub, not just for Apple for other electronics manufacturers as well. But you’re now starting to see the MacBook, the Apple Watch the iPad, all beginning to be produced in and assembled there in Vietnam. And that’s been a big push from Apple. I think it’s going to be interesting to see if any of the iPhone production shifts there, you know, but it’s a similar story, you know, do you have the expertise to be able to set up factories there that know how to do this? Obviously, Foxconn is the key player here for Apple. In terms of assembly, you know, they’re based in Taiwan. They’ve got their biggest operation for the iPhones up in Zhengzhou, China, you know, how can they set up shop? All of that those questions still remain. But the other funny thing about Vietnam a very interesting thing, you know, Apple has quietly become the third biggest smartphone player in Vietnam? Tom Chitty Against, I imagine, a whole host of Chinese smartphones? Arjun Kharpal There’s two ahead of them. Guess the companies. Tom Chitty Oppo? Arjun Kharpal Yeah, that’s two. Who’s number one? Tom Chitty Xiaomi? Arjun Kharpal Not Chinese. Tom Chitty Samsung? Arjun Kharpal Yeah. But very quietly, it has just sort of accumulated a strong position in Vietnam’s smartphone market, as well. That’s fascinating. Tom Chitty Well let’s move the lens to China and what they must be thinking the challenges to their own smartphone brands, because it feels as much about that as it does about the shifting of manufacturing, or at least some of the manufacturing. Do you think there’ll be some concerns, the fact that on their doorstep, Apple are making serious plays? Arjun Kharpal The Apple shift of manufacturing outside of China is a microcosm of a bigger battle that China is facing right now, and that is investor confidence in the country since Covid. You’ve seen Beijing really try to roll out the red carpet over the last",error,513
50," few months to foreign businesses, to get them to invest to build up confidence again. And so with a company like Apple, a global corporation, starts to diversify the supply chain, when other companies begin to reduce dependency on the market, China will be worried about that, particularly for it sort of foreign investments. In terms of the Chinese smartphone players, you know, they’re holding up pretty strong. They’re still doing very well in so many markets. Xiaomi and Oppo, in particular, have done extremely well globally. And I might take this opportunity to quickly talk about another Chinese company Transsion, probably no one’s ever heard of it. One of the top five big smartphone players in the world I think number four now. They own a brand called Tecno. One of the biggest smartphone players in the world right now. It’s a similar story to Oppo and Vivo a few years ago when these sort of brands came up, you know, oh these are sort of number three and four. Transsion has made big waves selling very aggressively priced smartphones into emerging markets around the world, actually barely sells into China. They sell outside Latin America, Africa, various other places as well. They have made big waves as well. So the Chinese smartphone players are doing pretty well. At the moment. Xiaomi in particular has seen a reviva. And of course in China, we’ve done the episode on it a few months back now, but Huawei has been sort of reviving as well and challenging Apple in China. In fact, China right now for Apple, in terms of from the sales point of view, is a difficult market. It’s a difficult market. It is facing renewed competition, like I said, from Huawei, some of the Chinese players are bringing out very strong high-end offerings. There were some figures out from IDC, just again, as we’re recording this podcast, that showed Apple’s global shipments in the first quarter down nearly 10% year on year. I think a large part of that is China here and some of the weakness in that market. So, you know, Apple is facing its own challenges in China, the Chinese smartphone players are holding up pretty well at the moment. I think for Apple, the question is, you know, it’s facing slowing global iPhone sales, and it needs some growth. And I think ultimately, when it looks at where the growth might come from,",error,513
50," it’s going to be looking at markets like India and like Vietnam, as it sort of plans for the next few years. It’s not tomorrow, all of a sudden, India and Vietnam are going to be you know, two of the biggest markets for Apple. No way. It’s gonna take a long time to build up that brand, to build up that customer base in the hopes that you know, these are the markets that might power company’s growth going forward and unlock billions, potentially 10s of billions dollars worth of sales. Tom Chitty Good stuff. Alright. We’ll leave it there. But before we go, we’ve got to do of course, stat of the week. Do you want to remind us what it was? Arjun Kharpal 18.8% market share, Tom. Tom Chitty I’m just gonna just say, I feel like you may have given this one away during the podcast. Arjun Kharpal Potentially. Might have been a red herring though. Tom Chitty Okay. Here we go. The market share of Apple smartphones in Vietnam. Arjun Kharpal I did purposefully say the Vietnam thing. But I thought maybe I’d throw you off because we were talking so much about India. Tom Chitty I know. But it was. I felt like I could see, you know, we’ve sat across from each other for a while and your face made a, you made a face, which suggested that there was something more to this. Arjun Kharpal Do I have a stat of the week face? Tom Chitty Yeah, you wouldn’t be great at poker. Are you any good at poker? Arjun Kharpal I haven’t played in a while. Yeah, I think my poker face is really bad. Yeah. I think I just sort of smile when I’ve got good cards and things like that. Tom Chitty You need to get some shades. Arjun Kharpal Yeah, I need to just wear sort of a mask. Tom Chitty Mask and shades. Cool. All right. Well, that’s it for this episode. I am on a bit of a run on stat of the week. Arjun Kharpal You are. You are doing really well? Yeah we need some prizes.   Tom Chitty All right, before we go, please follow and subscribe to the show.",error,513
63," at restaurants and retailers that has become a fixture of consumers’ brick-and-mortar spending. As part of its restrictions on third parties, Apple limits developers’ access to the iPhone’s near-field communication (NFC) capabilities, the technology that enables the frictionless experience users enjoy with Apple Pay. The DOJ wants Apple to release its hold on NFC, which the agency says would result in a “proliferation of other payment apps” to compete with Apple Pay. “It’s increasingly an important way that we transact,” said Matt Platkins, the attorney general of New Jersey, one of 15 states and Washington, D.C., that joined the DOJ’s case and the state where authorities filed the suit. “And yet Apple has decided to prohibit you from using it, except on their specific wallet, which is only available on an iPhone.” “All of that is hurting consumers,” Platkin said, “and limiting their choices in ways that we think violates the law.” Some of the changes U.S. prosecutors are seeking have already been won in the European Union, where regulators successfully pushed Apple to allow third-party developers direct access to the iPhone’s NFC functionality. That was the only E.U. case mentioned in the DOJ’s sprawling suit. “It is not an accident that iPhone users can only use one type of digital wallet to tap to pay,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. “Apple did not invent the near-field-communication technology that powers tap-to-pay, but they are trying to use its iPhone platform to be the exclusive provider for it in digital wallets inside its ecosystem.” Despite its concessions on NFC access in other parts of the world, Apple has said it remains concerned about users’ security under that approach. Apple has made strides in recent years to expand its footprint in financial services, from launching Apple Pay in 2014 to the Apple Card in 2019, which gives users 2% cash back on purchases made with an iPhone or Apple Watch. These moves have increasingly drawn the attention of government watchdogs who say they see Apple as another Big Tech player attempting to dominate a core U.S. industry. In remarks at a Federal Reserve event last fall, Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said “there is real",error,513

The fourth probe targets Alphabet, as the European Commission looks into whether the firm’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s,” other services such as Google Shopping, over similar rival offerings. “To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe,” Oliver Bethell, director of competition at Alphabet, said in a statement. “We have engaged with the European Commission, stakeholders and third parties in dozens of events over the past year to receive and respond to feedback, and to balance conflicting needs within the ecosystem. We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.” Alphabet pointed to a blog post from earlier this month, wherein the company outlined some of those changes — including giving Android phone users the option to easily change their default search engine and browser, as well as making it easier for people to see comparison sites in areas like shopping or flights in Google searches. The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called pay and consent model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service is in violation of the DMA. “The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during the news conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.” “Gatekeepers” is a label for large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU. “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said. Meta said subscriptions are a common business model across various industries. “Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,” a Meta spokesperson told CNBC",error,513
75," inaccurate content across social platforms. Lawmakers are currently even more concerned with the rapid rise of AI. “There is reason for serious concern about how AI could be used to mislead voters in campaigns,” Josh Becker, a Democratic state senator in California, told CNBC in a February interview. The new research determined that the tools offered by X were a “major disappointment,” as the company offered only a CSV file instead of a web interface, making it hard to search for ads. Lesplingart told CNBC that users had to know the advertiser name, targeted country and date of the advertisement in order to export to an ad file. “We are perhaps most disappointed to see X (formerly Twitter) make such a minimal effort, considering that it remains a central space for civic discourse,” the researchers wrote. “This may be why the European Commission has included X’s ad repository in its formal proceedings against the platform under the DSA.” Bing, Snapchat, Alibaba’s AliExpress and Zalando also received the lowest marks. Alphabet, Pinterest and Booking.com received the second-lowest designations. Apple’s App Store, LinkedIn, Meta and TikTok received higher marks, though they were graded as still having “big gaps” in data and functionality. “Our main takeaway is that even the best approaches don’t meet our baseline,” the researchers wrote. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Snap, TikTok, Pinterest, X, Alibaba and Zalando did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In regards to Alphabet’s transparency tools for Google Search and YouTube, the researchers said “it’s been six years and we still can’t search by keyword.” They reported accuracy issues and missing data on Pinterest and TikTok. On Bing’s tools, users can’t search words with special characters, they found. For Apple’s App Store tools, users and researchers can’t see ad campaigns broken down by targeted country, which is an important feature for tracking election-related disinformation, according to the study. “The effectiveness of these tools depends on their usefulness for researchers in practice,” the researchers wrote. They added, “But we’d also like to consider the glass half full, and look forward to further improvements.” WATCH: AI & deepfakes represent ‘a new type of information security",error,513
78," the Justice Department lawsuit against Apple is attempting to erect a new landmark decision for antitrust in the U.S., mostly by focusing on Apple’s entire ecosystem, not just a product, and whether how it functions represents anti-competitive conduct. In a statement provided to CNBC on Thursday, Apple said that the lawsuit “threatens who we are” and that it could hurt its ability to make competitive tech products. Apple provides more details about why it doesn’t like this kind of litigation in its SEC filings. The company says that when laws and regulations change, including antitrust litigation, it has to spend money to comply. “Imposed” changes can hurt customer demand, according to the filing, and when laws or regulations change, it creates uncertainty for Apple. Another challenge for Apple may be that a big, public trial like this one competes for executive time and attention, and more decisions inside Apple may have to go through legal review before going forward. Companies facing antitrust cases often need to loop employees who have nothing to do with trials into meetings, to sort through company documents, or help guide how the company will present evidence or technical arguments, Kovacic, a former FTC commissioner, said. “In past major antitrust cases, the real danger for the company is that the focus of attention becomes winning the antitrust lawsuits instead of winning customers and doing your job,” Kovacic said. “It slows you down. It’s a real drag.” For Apple, it’s not just the DOJ suit, but also new regulations in Europe, and investigations in other countries around the world that it has to deal with. The U.S. government hasn’t said what it wants Apple to do to fix its allegations, but its initial filing on Thursday left the matter open, with a broad request for overall remedy. One possibility includes forcing Apple to open the iPhone to third-party stores like it has in Europe. Many of the DOJ’s other allegations, like Apple’s alleged restrictions on third-party smartwatches and “super apps” don’t have close recent parallels in other countries or markets. The DOJ could also find remedies that aim to reorient the entire technology industry or future products. “If and when this thing gets to trial, I would expect that it will not just be about smartphones, even though that’s the core of the story.

83," challenges and fines in China, underscoring the limits of corporate diplomacy, particularly for the technology sector. It can be argued that the turning point came long ago, with Google’s high-profile exit from China in 2010, despite previous attempts by its CEOs to engage with Chinese authorities. The challenges faced by Google underscore the complexities of operating in China under its stringent regulatory environment, regardless of adroit high-level CEO diplomacy.   The Facebook case is particularly instructive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to notable lengths to court China, demonstrating a willingness to engage deeply with Chinese culture and business practices. He learned Mandarin and used it to communicate during public appearances and meetings in China. He was photographed jogging through Tiananmen Square in Beijing. These actions were part of a broader strategy to make Facebook palatable to Chinese authorities and gain entry into the lucrative Chinese market. But despite Zuckerberg’s concerted efforts, Facebook remains blocked in China, with the Great Firewall preventing access to the platform. The Chinese government’s stringent control over the internet and social media, coupled with its push to support domestic social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat, created a nearly insurmountable barrier. In this environment, Tim Cook’s attempts to pull out all the stops will not be rewarded over the long-term. It’s not that the Apple CEO is doing anything wrong. He is executing textbook corporate diplomacy.  The problem is that in this environment, not only does China have concerns about Western tech and Western companies, but the China of today also has formidable options to replace foreign companies with its own champions. That makes the playbook a limited impact one for advancing the interests of foreign businesses over the long-term, given how much has changed since Volkswagen and Boeing and others pioneered the high-flying CEO visit to China strategy. Despite Cook’s efforts, Apple faces declining sales in China, a testament to the growing domestic competition, security concerns about foreign hardware and software, and an increasingly nationalistic and patriotic Chinese consumers. The resurgence of domestic champions like Huawei, buoyed by the new nationalistic fervor and government support, illustrates a market increasingly resistant to foreign dominance. Strategic alignment with China’s market and technological ambitions risks ensnaring companies in the crossfires of the escalating trade and technology wars between the U.S. and China. This battleground, marked by efforts to control emerging technologies with potential military applications, presents a perilous terrain for companies caught between nationalistic policies and their own global",error,513

Spotify in a statement called the commission’s decision “an important moment in the fight for a more open internet for consumers.” “Apple’s rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits—denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks,” Spotify said. “Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour.” The commission said Apple prevented developers of music streaming apps from informing their iOS users within their apps about prices of subscriptions or offers available elsewhere. App developers could not include links in their apps leading iOS users to the app developers’ websites where alternative subscription could be bought, the commission alleges. The EU’s executive arm also said Apple prevented app developers from contacting their own newly acquired users — for example via email — to inform them about alternative pricing options. In a press briefing, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager qualified the basic amount of the fine for Apple, excluding the 1.8 billion euro lump sum, as “quite small” and likened it to a “speeding ticket, or a parking ticket” relative to the company’s scale. “When Apple imposes these anti-steering provisions on the music provider, they as developers have no other choice than to either accept them or abandon the App store. Apple with its App Store currently holds a monopoly,” Vestager said. She added the commission has ordered Apple to remove the so-called anti-steering provisions and to “refrain from similar practices in the future.” The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms. Last year, the commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.

102," -- more than 57% higher than its retail price in the U.S. Just one day after CEO Tim Cook took part in a splashy launch of the Apple Vision Pro at the company’s flagship store in New York, a well-known Russian tech blogger who goes by “Romancev768” posted a video to his more than 1 million followers, showing him unboxing his own Apple headset and demonstrating how it works. A few days later, he posted a video offering his opinions on the device as he walked through the posh Moscow district of Patriarshiye. Seated in a restaurant, he tells viewers that even though he has the volume all the way up, customers near him can’t hear anything. He shows himself testing the device at the re:Store shop in Moscow’s shopping mall called “GUM,” located adjacent to Red Square, across from the Kremlin.  The blogger’s real-world name is Sergey Romantsev. In an email exchange with CNBC, he explained how he got the Vision Pro in Moscow so quickly: “There’s nothing complicated about it,” he wrote, saying his team placed a preorder for the device in New York. “The person received it on the day of the start of sales and immediately flew to Moscow,” Romantsev wrote. “Through New York, Istanbul, Moscow, we brought Vision very quickly.” He explained that Apple devices, though expensive, are available in Russia. “Officially, Apple does not sell anything in Russia. Russian companies buy equipment in other countries and bring it to their stores. This has led to a huge increase in prices. So Vision Pro in Moscow costs not $3,500 but $5,000.” But some consumers, at least, are willing to pay that price: “Apple is very popular in Russia and we keep an eye on all new products,” Romantsev wrote. “We are trying to get them. It’s difficult.”  He said he has no difficulty operating his Vision Pro in Russia. But it’s a different picture with the competing American product from Meta, the Meta Quest 3. In 2022, a Russian court banned Facebook and Instagram from the country after Meta loosened its policies on hate speech toward Russian soldiers in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Meta is recognized as an extremist",error,513
102," organization in Russia,” Romantsev wrote. “Meta servers are blocked in Russia. To activate Quest 3, you need to install a VPN on your home WiFi. There are also a lot of restrictions, since constant work via VPN is very difficult.” A Meta spokesperson declined to comment for this story. None of this has happened by accident. The Russian government has done what it can to ensure that many Western products continue to flow into the country. In 2022, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a document permitting Apple products to be imported to Russia even when official supplies to Russia are banned or suspended by the manufacturer. In Russia, this is known as “parallel import.” The exact supply chain feeding this demand is unclear, but likely involves former Soviet republics or Middle Eastern import-export businesses.  Back in 2022, Apple laid out a specific set of steps it would take to dial back its business in Russia. The company said it had “paused” all product sales in Russia and stopped all exports into Apple’s sales channel in country. The company said it removed Russian state-controlled media outlets RT News and Sputnik News from the App Store outside of Russia, and limited Apple Pay and other services.  Some internet activists in 2022 urged American tech firms to continue to supply Russian customers with the tools they need to access information on the open internet, and especially messaging apps such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Threema. But even before it pulled out of the country in 2022, Apple had struggled to balance open access with the demands of the Russian government. According to media reports, the company deleted an app associated with the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian prison this week, and agreed to promote Russian state-operated apps in the country. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the moves.  For all that, the continued sales of Apple’s consumer-focused products in Russia are not likely to raise eyebrows in Washington. “We’re focused on disrupting Russia’s procurement of items for the military industrial base,” a White House official told CNBC. “In general, we don’t have a comprehensive trade embargo in place and there are exceptions for many communications-related devices across our sanctions and export controls, as long as they aren’t going to sanctioned Russian end users,” the official said. — CNBC’s Steve Kovach contributed to",error,513
105," Jacky Qiu, co-founder of OTI Lumionics, which makes materials for manufacturing OLED panels. He said display makers fight for Apple’s business, which can be make or break for these companies. “Apple is now the biggest player in terms of OLEDs, in terms of displays. They are the ones that are basically taking all the high-margin displays, all the stuff that is the high-spec type of stuff that is allowing the panel makers today to become profitable,” Qiu said. “You look at the display business, you either work for Apple and make the iPhone screens and you’re profitable, or you don’t, and you lose money. It’s as brutal as that,” Qiu said. The Vision Pro’s displays are a defining feature. They’re packed with pixels and are sharper than any competing headset. It’s one of the main points that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg complimented when comparing the $499 Quest 3 headset to Apple’s headset. “Apple’s screen does have a higher resolution and that’s really nice,” Zuckerberg said in a video posted on his Instagram page, while saying that Quest’s screens are brighter. “What’s so revolutionary about the OLED displays that are in the Vision Pro, the difference between Micro OLED and the OLED that you find on a television in your living room is that the pixels are actually a lot denser, they’re smaller and they’re more compact,” said Wayne Rickard, CEO of Terecircuits, a company that makes materials and techniques for display manufacturing. According to a teardown analysis from repair firm iFixit, each Vision Pro display has a resolution of 3660 by 3200 pixels. That’s more pixels per eye than the iPhone 15, which has a screen resolution of 2556 by 1179 pixels. Meta’s Quest 3 comes in at a resolution of 2,064 by 2,208 per eye. The Vision Pro’s screens are much smaller than the iPhone’s screen, which makes the pixels closer together, and more difficult to manufacture. The Vision Pro displays have 3,386 pixels per inch versus the iPhone 15, which has about 460 pixels per inch on its display. In total, Apple says the Vision Pro’s displays have more than 23 million total pixels. They’re some of the",error,513
105," densest displays ever built. According to iFixit, 54 Vision Pro pixels can fit in a single iPhone pixel, and each pixel is about 7.5 microns from the next pixel, a measurement called “pixel pitch,” according to Apple’s specifications. “With Micro LEDs in particular, it can get down to about below 10 microns. For comparison, a red blood cell might be about 20 microns, so half the size of a red blood cell,” Rickard said. Apple opted for high-resolution displays so they’d be closer to simulating reality when using the headset’s passthrough mode, which uses outward-facing cameras to show video of the real world inside the headset. It also helps users read text or numbers in virtual reality. It helps remove the “screen door” effect of other headsets where you can see the pixels. VR headsets need pixel-dense displays because the user’s eyes are so close to the screen. TVs have significantly fewer pixels, but it doesn’t matter because viewers are feet away. The production of this kind of display requires cutting-edge manufacturing. For example, most displays are built on a backplane made out of glass. The Vision Pro displays are so pixel-dense that they use a silicon backplane, much like a semiconductor. The second most expensive part in the Vision Pro is the company’s main processor, which includes Apple’s M2 chip, the same chip it uses in the MacBook Air, and the R1 chip, which is a custom processor to handle video feeds and other sensors on the device. Bill of materials estimates don’t take into account research and development costs, packaging or shipping. They also don’t take into account capital expenditures that can add up-front costs to big parts orders, but they’re useful for people in the manufacturing world to get an idea of how expensive the parts are in any given device. Display technologies embraced by Apple typically come down in price after Apple makes them mainstream and as multiple suppliers compete for business. “South Korean suppliers like Samsung Display and LG Display have shown their interest in this technology. Chinese suppliers like Seeya and BOE are also small-scale mass-produced [OLED on silicon] products,” said Jay Shao, Omdia analyst for displays, in an email. He expects the costs for Vision Pro spec screens to come down in the coming years",error,513
111,"” iOS apps that integrate with Apple software that it built to comply with the DMA. Apple will know which companies are running app stores, and the company will be able to revoke those permissions if the other app stores are filled with scams or malware. For users, it means that apps installed from alternative app stores will show up in settings, with details about when they were downloaded and from where. When developers upload an app for Europe, they will be able to pick which app store they’d like to distribute it from. Apple will “notarize” the apps, meaning the company will scan them for malware and other code issues. For developers like Spotify and Microsoft, which have expressed interest in distributing apps outside the App Store in Europe, the rules do not contradict their stated plans, but Apple’s implementation does add hurdles beyond offering an installation file for download on their website. Apple will also allow app developers to bill their users directly. Previously, apps could only charge users for digital goods — game coins, for example — through Apple’s billing system, which takes between 15% and 30% of total sales. Now, Apple will allow iPhone app developers to take credit card numbers inside the app, or app developers can choose to link users to their website to collect their payment information. However, Apple said Thursday it still planned to collect fees and commissions from apps even if they handle their own payments or distribute through an alternative app store. Developers can stick with the current system, but if they opt for one of the new capabilities in Europe, Apple will start charging reduced commission rates in Europe but add an install fee for popular apps. “Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer,” Schiller said in the statement. Here are the new business terms, according to Apple: The DMA has been in the works for years. Spotify, among other companies, lobbied heavily for it starting in 2019. It goes into effect in March, but other parts of Apple’s business could come under scrutiny as the European Commission continues to examine Apple’s business practices — in particular, it may focus on making Apple’s iMessage service interoperable with competitors. On Thursday, Apple also made changes to the way it makes its digital wallet technology accessible, as well as allowing competitors to use different underlying web browser technology. Earlier this month, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission antitrust chief, visited Apple CEO Tim Cook in California. She",error,513
118,". With the Vision Pro, there are three key parts that come into play. It has super sharp and colorful screens, it allows you to see the world around you by default using “passthrough” technology, and it has a fast processor. The displays help remove the “screendoor” effect that’s common in lower-cost headsets like the Meta Quest 3. That’s where you can see the pixels as you look through a headset. You can easily read text on a website or a book on the Vision Pro. And I was able to watch movies, including in 3D, on screens bigger and nicer than any TV in my house. The Quest 3 and other headsets also have passthrough. But Apple’s works better. It’s clearer and sharper, enough so that I can comfortably see the room around me in full color and without any lag, though I still can’t read my phone. And I love how you can turn the small digital crown, just like on the Apple Watch or AirPods Max, to adjust the volume or transport yourself into a fully 3D landscape. Virtual travel is a nice touch. You can work or watch movies in Hawaii, by a lake, in White Sands or at Joshua Tree. They’re all relaxing environments with calming sounds and slow animations – like clouds moving across the sky — that help you feel like you’re almost there. Navigation is easy once you get the hang of it. This reminds me a bit of the iPhone moment, when Apple launched its multitouch display that changed how we interact with phones that had largely been navigated with a stylus, touchpad or keyboard. There aren’t any controllers here. The headset uses sensors to track your eyes (and even verify when you’re making purchases online or in the App Store.) Apple has a quick setup process that aligns the headset to your eyes and then has you look at a series of dots, pinching your fingers as you go so you can calibrate. If you wear glasses, Apple also sells inserts that pop into the headset. It’s incredibly accurate. You just look where you want to go and then tap your thumb and index finger to select a button or app. There’s a white bar at the bottom of every app, for example, that you can grab to pull and push around. You can adjust the size of any app by looking at the corner and then dragging it out",error,513
118," or in at a diagonal angle. And you can swipe through photos or scroll websites by holding your index finger and thumb together while pulling up or down. Likewise, you zoom in and out by holding those fingers on both hands and pulling outward or inward. You don’t have to flail your hands in front of you. The headset’s external cameras can detect your fingers down in your lap. You can be subtle. It packs a punch. I launched more than a dozen apps around me. There’s no point in doing more, because you can’t see it all. I loved setting it up with a browser in front of me, music next to me and a TV screen above it all. But the world is yours to customize. You can open mail and a browser or leave Slack open next to a Word document with your calendar on the other side. Put your text messages on the ceiling if you want. It’s a completely new way to multitask. A note: My screenshots show apps askew. But, in the headset, they’re all perfectly level. I didn’t run into any slowdowns during my time with the Vision Pro. Part of that is due to how Apple renders content. It’s technically only sharpening the areas of the screen where you’re focusing, leaving the other areas blurry. That’s why some of the screenshots here look out of focus around the sides. Inside the headset, it’s all super crisp. It’s called foveated rendering, and it allows for optimized processing. I loved watching movies with the headset. I lounged on my couch and put up a huge screen across the wall of my living room and watched an hour of “Barbie,” and the two first episodes of “Masters of the Air” before the battery was at about 5%. Another night I watched “Greyhound.” I used the NBA app, which was updated to work on the Vision Pro, to stream four games at once, with the main game in the middle and others pinned to the sides. It’s wild. Apple also has some specially recorded content that’s so sharp you feel like you’re standing right there next to a rendered dinosaur or a video of a rhinoceros. There’s a slightly terrifying clip with a woman walking on a tightrope between cliffs. Don’t watch if you",error,513
118,"’re afraid of heights. The clips show the type of content third parties will eventually be able record and publish to the headset. I imagine sports highlights or even sitting courtside at a live game.   The Disney+ app is fun. You can watch movies in one of about four different 3D landscapes. I sat in a racer on Tatooine and watched a bit of a Star Wars movie, but then switched over to watch “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse” in 3D. Unlike 3D TVs and movies, which generally flopped, the effects work well in the headset. It’s neat, but I still prefer watching movies in 2D. It feels more natural to me. FaceTime works well. You see a clear video of the person you’re calling on a screen in front of you. But they don’t see you. Or, not the real you. They see a 3D-rendered version of you called a digital Persona. It’s still in beta, and mine looked like a much older version of me. My colleague thought I looked like an 80-year-old man. My wife laughed. You create a Persona by selecting an option in the settings menu and then removing the headset and following screens on the external display. It asks you to look up, look down, look left, look right, smile, smile with teeth, and close your eyes. Then, in seconds, it creates a 3D Persona. It looks more human than cartoony like with other headsets. I spoke with people over FaceTime also using Personas, and it’s much easier to hold a conversation without feeling like you’re two goofy avatars trying to talk. You can hold a real meeting if necessary in your pajamas while your Persona is in work attire. Personas also carry over to other apps like WebEx. Your Persona’s eyes can appear on the outside display. Someone will see glowing effects on the outside of the headset if you have screens up in front of you. If they begin talking to you and you’re in an immersive view – like one of the landscapes I mentioned earlier – they’ll start to fade into focus so you can see them. As you look at them, the eyes of your digital Persona become visible on the outside of the headset. It looks like you’re wearing a snorkeling mask. In real life, I just removed the headset face when",error,513
118," my wife came in to chat. The built-in speakers are great. They get nice and loud and support spatial audio, so if you turn your head away from the movie in front of you, the sound stays in the same place, much like if you were watching a real TV. Music and movies sounded fantastic, with full surround sound. People can hear the audio coming out of the headset, though, so you’ll want to use AirPods in public. I love the “spatial photos” you can capture using the cameras on the outside of the Vision Pro or with the latest iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The camera creates a 3D version of a photo or video. I filmed my 4-month-old daughter eating and my dog’s 9th birthday, for example, in hopes that I’ll be able to come back and relive some of those moments. I wish I had recorded some of these videos when my stepfather was alive because it’d feel like he was in the room with me. Some people might see it as a gimmick, but I found it moving. Lastly, the build quality is superb. Apple used top-of-the-line glass, screens and metals. It feels like a premium headset and it’s comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that I had to be deliberate to hold it by the metal frame. The padded inserts pop off their magnets if you try to grab them. Those could be stronger, but they were designed to be easily removed so people could share the headset by popping in their own inserts. Apple’s apps work well. You’ll find Notes, Music, Safari, Podcasts, Photos, Apple TV+, Maps and more. Other apps include SkyGuide and Disney+ and there are Apple Arcade games. Many more are coming, as most apps haven’t yet been built specifically for Vision Pro. The Vision Pro supports more than a million iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to search for each app individually and some of them aren’t available. Netflix and Spotify haven’t been shy about not supporting the Vision Pro, though you can easily access either using the browser. Still, there are lots of others that I couldn’t find: 1Password isn’t there, which made logging into some apps a bit of a pain. You won’t find Uber, DoorDash (but there’s GrubHub!) or Amazon.",error,513
118," None of Google’s apps are here, including YouTube TV, though it works fine in the browser. Popular games like Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact aren’t available. Facebook’s apps aren’t here, so no Instagram. These are just a few I noticed. Some work well, though. I didn’t have any issues with the X iPad app, for example. CNBC’s app worked fine. Others, like Amazon Prime Video, exist but weren’t great during initial tests. A bug showed a big box in the middle of the screen when I was watching a movie. That bug has since been fixed. For some apps that aren’t yet available, developers are working to optimize them and eliminate bugs. Apple Keychain was sometimes buggy in iPad apps. This is Apple’s version of 1Password, and I rely on it to enter my username and passwords. It generally works fine. But if you have two usernames for apps, like my wife and I do for Amazon Prime Video or Peacock, the app locks up when you try to select a different login. I informed Apple of the bug. The floating keyboard is useful for search or typing quick messages, but you won’t be able to type very fast at first. You look at each letter on a digital keyboard and select it, or reach out and tap the digital keyboard. I got faster during my time with the Vision Pro, but nowhere near as quick as I am on my iPhone or a real keyboard. You can just use Siri voice-to-text to respond to iMessages or enter URLs in the browser (and launch apps). Still, you’re going to want to use a keyboard if you have to do a lot of typing. There’s also the battery pack that plugs into the headset with a proprietary plug that you twist in. I don’t mind it. I thought the pack worked fine, but it would be a lot easier if it was just embedded into the headset, though that would add weight. I’d buy the Vision Pro right now if I had an extra $3,500. I’d even consider trading in my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro to offset the cost since the headset gives me a lot of the same capabilities. But that’s not an option. You’ll definitely love it for movies. I think a lot of people will also really enjoy being able to read the news",error,513
129,"�a success” and showed “how our app helps create meaningful relationships between young people.” “All of the influencers who spent the week with us say they are excited to participate in Wizz House 2, and others have reached out saying they want to join,” the spokesperson said. The Wizz app has been used by people to find and connect with young users in “financial sextortion” scams, according to a recent study by the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit organization that studies the spread of extremism, hatred and crime online to help combat and prevent it. The FBI defines sextortion as “a crime that involves adults coercing kids and teens into sending explicit images online.” After the images are sent, the criminals threaten to widely publish or send the explicit photos or videos to the victims’ friends and family, unless the victims pay up repeatedly through a variety of peer-to-peer payment apps, gift cards and cryptocurrency transfers. Sextortion can be so devastating that victims died by suicide in at least 20 known cases in the United States, according to the FBI. In its most recent study of rising sextortion levels in North America and Australia, the institute strongly criticized Wizz, along with Meta-owned Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, for what it called an inadequate effort to protect minors and young adults online. “Some victims report being targeted by sextortion within minutes of joining the app, suggesting that criminals have saturated Wizz,” the study said, adding that researchers found frequent  complaints to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store about Wizz, with users claiming the app was “serving pornographic ads to minors.” Adam Sohn, CEO of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said in an email that generally, “social media platforms struggle to adequately address” risks to underage users and “are at times financially incentivized to overlook them.” The research institute’s director of intelligence, Alex Goldenberg, said app stores can significantly impact the reach of social media platforms. “Wizz has something in the ballpark of 20 million active users,” he said. “But if the app store doesn’t continue to carry it, they cannot sustain, let alone grow, their user base.” Goldenberg said that he believes Wizz’s age verification system is not strong enough. “We’ve seen threat actors who",error,513
130,", which includes subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties, search licensing revenue, and payments from Apple Pay and Apple’s advertisements.   Apple said it had 2.2 billion active devices in use, a metric that many analysts say informs how they forecast Apple’s services growth. That’s up from 2 billion active devices at the same time last year.   Cook attributed services growth to products including advertising, cloud services, payments, and the company’s App Store. He said that Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to apps through the App Store.   Apple showed sales growth in all regions except for Greater China, which fell nearly 13% from the same time last year, potentially stoking fears of receding demand for Apple in its third-largest market. It has faced increased competition from local firms such as Huawei. Greater China includes the mainland in addition to Hong Kong and Taiwan.   Cook told CNBC’s Kovach that iPhone sales in the region was what “everyone seemed to be focused on.”  “If you look at the 13 and then you do a double click to look at Mainland China and look at constant currency, the dollar is very strong versus the RMB,” Cook said. “And so that -13 goes to a mid-single digit number. And so that’s how we did on the phone last quarter. The good news is that we’re four out of the top six top-selling smartphones in urban China.”  Mac sales grew less than 1% during the quarter to $7.7 billion, in line with estimates. It’s a significant recovery for the product line, which fell nearly 34% on an annual basis in the September quarter.   IPad sales continue to slump, falling 25% during the quarter to $7.02 billion, slightly short of Street estimates. Apple didn’t release a new iPad model in 2023 for the first time in the product’s history.   Cook said that iPad performance “wasn’t a surprise to us.”   “The iPad faced a very difficult comp, if you recall, in the year-ago quarter where we launched iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation,” Cook said.   The company’s wearables business, sometimes called “Other Products,” includes AirPods headphones and the Apple Watch. It also had a rough quarter, declining 11",error,513
137," and support its $3 trillion market cap, Apple needs some new products to hit and global demand for smartphones and laptops to recover. A big test will come early next year, when Apple’s first mixed-reality headset — the $3,499 Vision Pro — hits the market. “We believe success with the Vision Pro is less about 2024 and more about its longer-term potential,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this month. Assuming Apple ships 400,000 headsets, Vision Pro revenue could be about $1.4 billion next year, according to an estimate from UBS analyst David Vogt. He called the sum “relatively immaterial.” Enthusiasm will be the key. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first completely new device since it announced the Apple Watch, and it will be sold through Apple stores. The headset could generate foot traffic and buzz for Apple’s existing products. And there’s a chance that it catches on enough to show that Apple has the lead when it comes to the future of computing. Looking overseas, Apple would like to see an easing of tensions between the U.S. and China. In 2023, Apple made significant progress diversifying its centers of production away from mainland China and into countries like Vietnam and India. But its moves to expand its supply chain appear to have awakened an impulse in the Chinese government to classify Apple as a foreign company. The White House called reports that Chinese government agencies told their employees not to bring iPhones to work “retaliation.” The Chinese government has denied them. Yet analysts are starting to worry that Chinese demand for iPhones, especially in the current quarter, is flagging. The iPhone remains Apple’s most important hardware product, accounting for about half of total company revenue. “Heading into the holiday season, iPhone unit demand remains the key near-term debate amidst macro woes and concerns around potential share loss in China on the resurgence of Huawei,” Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note this month. Despite its struggles, Apple remains a juggernaut. The company recorded $383 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2023 and earned nearly $97 billion in net income.  Because the smartphone and PC markets were in retreat, Apple gained market share in some countries, where rivals saw steeper declines. In February, Apple said it had 2 billion devices in use, a closely watched metric that investors see as a predictor of future sales from software and services.",error,513
146," Journal entries aren’t published anywhere, just stored inside your individual Journal app. Where the machine learning magic appears is under the magic wand icon, or the “moments menu.” When you tap the magic wand icon, it suggests things to write about based on what it knows from your phone, such as the music you were listening to or where you were. For example, when I pressed the moments tab on Monday, it suggested I write about a recent vacation — bringing up a map of where I was, hikes I did while I was on the trip, music I listened to and photos I took when I was there. For one entry, I simply recorded an audio file of the waves crashing, so I could return to the moment later. However, it didn’t realize that I had already fully documented that vacation inside the Journal app. The Journal app’s push notifications can also prompt the user. It often sends a push notification when it detects that you’ve done an activity that you might want to reflect on. For example, I recently had to rush to catch a ferry. My watch noted a walking workout, and I was listening to music at the time. Journaling workouts could be very useful for people who are training for marathons or other athletic achievements. The Journal app also sent me notifications asking whether I wanted to write about the experience. Some days, notifications sent by the app simply ask you to reflect on your day. Apple also includes several prompts designed to spur reflection: “Make an audio recording of your surroundings. Write about what you notice.” The app can also be social, suggesting to journal about activities with others when it detects contacts nearby. Apple’s Journal app is basic right now. Nothing it does besides suggestions couldn’t be done in an old-fashioned paper journal, or even a page inside Apple’s Notes app. But the suggestions and integration with Apple’s other services set it apart from more low-tech approaches and highlight how Apple’s integration of hardware and software means that it can learn what’s important in your life without collecting your data on its servers. Apple is even making its machine learning model that guesses what might be important to the user available to other apps through a programming interface, meaning other apps could benefit from Apple’s AI. Apple needs to continue to improve the Journal app to find a place in most people’s everyday routines. It would be better if it could automatically fill",error,513
171,", Apple bought P.A. Semiconductor, a 150-person startup, for $278 million. “They’re going to start doing their own chips: that was the immediate takeaway when they bought P.A. Semi,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. With its “inherent design focus,” Bajarin said, Apple wants “to control as much of the stack” as possible. Two years after the acquisition, Apple launched its first custom chip, the A4, in the iPhone 4 and original iPad. “We built what we call the unified memory architecture that is scalable across products,” Srouji said. “We built an architecture that you start with the iPhone, but then we scaled it to the iPad and then to the watch and eventually to the Mac.” Apple’s silicon team has grown to thousands of engineers working across labs all over the world, including in Israel, Germany, Austria, the U.K. and Japan. Within the U.S., the company has facilities in Silicon Valley, San Diego and Austin, Texas. The primary type of chip Apple is developing is known as a system on a chip, or SoC. That brings together the central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU) and other components, Bajarin explained, adding that for Apple there’s also a neural processing unit (NPU) “that runs the neural engine.” “It is the silicon and all of the blocks that go on to that silicon,” Bajarin said. Apple’s first SoC was the A series, which has advanced from the A4 in 2010 to the A17 Pro announced in September of this year. It’s the central processor in iPhones, as well as some iPads, Apple TVs and the HomePod. Apple’s other major SoC is the M series, first released in 2020, which now powers all new Macs and more advanced iPads. That product is up to the M3 line. Launched in 2015, the S series is a smaller system in package, or SiP, for Apple Watch. H and W chips are used in AirPods. U chips allow communication between Apple devices. And the newest chip, the R1, is set to ship early next year in Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Dedicated to processing input from the device’s cameras",error,513
171,", sensors and microphones, Apple says it will stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds. “We get to design the chips ahead of time,” Srouji said. He added that his staffers work with Ternus’s team “to exactly and precisely build chips that are going to be targeted for those products, and only for those products.” The H2 inside the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, for instance, enables better noise cancellation. Inside the new Series 9 Apple Watch, the S9 allows for unusual capabilities like double tap. In iPhones, the A11 Bionic in 2017 had the first Apple Neural Engine, a dedicated part of the SoC for performing AI tasks totally on-device. The latest A17 Pro announced in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max in September enables major leaps in features like computational photography and advanced rendering for gaming. “It was actually the biggest redesign in GPU architecture and Apple silicon history,” said Kaiann Drance, who leads marketing for the iPhone. “We have hardware accelerated ray tracing for the first time. And we have mesh shading acceleration, which allows game developers to create some really stunning visual effects.” That’s led to the development of iPhone-native versions from Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Division Resurgence and Capcom’s Resident Evil 4.   Apple says the A17 Pro is the first 3-nanometer chip to ship at high volume. “The reason we use 3-nanometer is it gives us the ability to pack more transistors in a given dimension. That is important for the product and much better power efficiency,” Srouji said. “Even though we’re not a chip company, we are leading the industry for a reason.” Apple’s leap to 3-nanometer continued with the M3 chips for Mac computers, announced in October. Apple says the M3 enables features like 22-hour battery life and, similar to the A17 Pro, boosted graphics performance. “It’s early days,” said Ternus, who’s been at Apple for 22 years. “We have a lot of work to do, but I think there’s so many Macs now, pretty much all Macs are capable of running Triple-A titles, which is not what it was like five years ago.” Ternus said that when he started",error,513
171,", “the way we tended to make products is we were using technologies from other companies, and we were effectively building the product around that.” Despite a focus on beautiful design, “they were constrained by what was available,” he said. In a major shift for the semiconductor industry, Apple turned away from using Intel’s PC processors in 2020, switching to its own M1 chip inside the MacBook Air and other Macs. “It was almost like the laws of physics had changed,” Ternus said. “All of a sudden we could build a MacBook Air that’s incredibly thin and light, has no fan, 18 hours of battery life, and outperformed the MacBook Pro that we had just been shipping.” He said the newest MacBook Pro with Apple’s most advanced chip, the M3 Max, “is 11 times faster than the fastest Intel MacBook Pro we were making. And we were shipping that just two years ago.” Intel processors are based on x86 architecture, the traditional choice for PC makers, with a lot of software developed for it. Apple bases its processors on rival Arm architecture, known for using less power and helping laptop batteries last longer. Apple’s M1 in 2020 was a proving point for Arm-based processors in high-end computers, with other big names like Qualcomm — and reportedly AMD and Nvidia — also developing Arm-based PC processors. In September, Apple extended its deal with Arm through at least 2040.  When its first custom chip came out 13 years ago, Apple was unusual as a non-chip company trying to make it in the cutthroat, cost-prohibitive semiconductor market. Since then, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla have tried their hand at custom chips. “Apple was sort of the trailblazer,” said Stacy Rasgon, managing director and senior analyst at Bernstein Research. “They sort of showed that if you do this, you can have a stab at differentiating your products.” Apple isn’t yet making every piece of silicon in its devices. Modems, for example, are one big component the company has yet to conquer on its own. “The processors have been remarkably good. Where they’ve struggled is on the modem side, is on the radio side in the phones,” Rasgon said. “Modems are hard.” Apple relies on Qualcomm for its modems,",error,513
171," although in 2019, the two companies settled a two-year legal battle over intellectual property. Soon after, Apple bought the majority of Intel’s 5G modem business for $1 billion, in a likely move to develop its own cellular modem. That hasn’t happened yet, and in September, Apple signed on with Qualcomm to supply its modems through 2026. “Qualcomm still makes the best modems in the world,” Bajarin said. “Until Apple can do as good of a job, I have a hard time seeing them fully jump to that.” Apple’s Srouji said he couldn’t comment on “future technologies and products” but said “we care about cellular, and we have teams enabling that.” Apple is also reportedly working on its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. For now, it has a fresh multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom for wireless components. Apple relies on third parties like Samsung and Micron for memory. “Our aspiration is the product,” Srouji said, when asked if Apple will try to design every part of its chips. “We want to build the best products on the planet. As a technology team, which also includes the chips in this case, we want to build the best technology that would enable that vision.” To deliver on that objective, Apple will “buy off the shelf” if it means the team can focus “on what really, really matters,” Srouji said. Regardless of how much silicon Apple eventually designs, it still needs to manufacture its chips externally. That requires massive fabrication plants owned by foundry companies like TSMC. More than 90% of the world’s advanced chips are made by TSMC in Taiwan, which leaves Apple and the rest of the industry vulnerable to the China threat of invasion. “There is obviously a lot of tension around, like, what would plan B be if that happened?” Bajarin said. “There isn’t another good option. You would hope that Samsung is also competitive and Intel wants to be there. But again, we’re not right now. It’s really all at TSMC.” Apple is at least looking to bring some of that manufacturing to the U.S. It’s committed to becoming the largest customer at TSMC’s coming fab in Arizona",error,513
171,". And on Thursday Apple announced it will be the first and largest customer of the new $2 billion Amkor manufacturing and packaging facility being built in Peoria, Arizona. Amkor will package Apple silicon produced at TSMC’s Arizona fab. “We always want to have a diversified supply: Asia, Europe and the U.S., which is why I think TSMC building fabs in Arizona is great,” Srouji said. Another concern is the shortage of skilled chip labor in the U.S., where advanced fabs haven’t been built for decades. TSMC says its Arizona fab is now delayed to 2025 because of a lack of skilled workers. Whether or not it has to do with a shortage of talent, Apple has seen a slowdown in the release of new chips. “Generations are taking longer because they are getting harder and harder,” Srouji said. “And the ability to pack more and get power efficiency is also different than 10 years ago.” Srouji reiterated his view that Apple has an advantage in that regard because “I don’t need to worry about where do I send my chips, how do I target a larger customer base?” Still, Apple’s actions underscore the competitiveness in the market. In 2019, Apple chip architect Gerard Williams left to lead a data center chip startup called Nuvia, bringing some Apple engineers with him. Apple sued Williams over IP concerns, before dropping the case this year. Qualcomm bought Nuvia in 2021, in a move to compete in Arm-based PC processors like Apple’s. “I can’t really discuss legal matters, but we truly care about IP protection,” Srouji said. “When certain people leave for certain reasons, that’s their choice.” Apple has additional macro challenges in its core business because smartphone sales are just recovering from their lowest levels in years. However, demand for AI workloads is leading to a surge in orders for silicon, especially for GPUs made by companies like Nvidia, whose stock has jumped more than 200% this year tied to the popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI services. Google has designed a tensor processing unit for AI since 2016. Amazon Web Services has had its own AI chips for the data center since 2018. Microsoft released its new AI chip in November. Srouji said his team at Apple has been working on its machine learning engines, the Apple",error,513
172," while Apple bars it. “The big difference between Apple and Google is Apple didn’t write anything down. And because they’re a big vertically integrated monopoly, they don’t do deals with developers and carriers to shut down competition, they just simply block at the technical level,” Sweeney said. During the Google trial, Epic Games instead focused on whether Google locked up the app store market through deals with handset makers, and whether it scared users away from using Android’s sideloading functionality through security warnings. It specifically called out secretive revenue-sharing contract deals with Samsung and Chinese handset makers, which these partners allegedly signed in exchange for supporting the Google Play Store on new devices. It also revealed that Google had entered into talks with Epic Games over an investment in the Fortnite maker. U.S. District Judge James Donato will hold hearings in January to determine what changes Google will have to make. Google might have to alter its Google Play Store rules, including opening up an option for billing and distribution outside of the store. Epic will push for lower fees, alternatives to Google Play and less scary warnings about installing software from the internet, Sweeney said. He added that Epic Games is not seeking monetary damages. Sweeney is not optimistic that change will be immediate. “If Google is obstructing a vertical remedy through appeals and isn’t offering an awesome deal,” Sweeney said, the company will not be on Google’s services. Google said it will appeal the decision. Google previously reached settlements with consumers, state attorneys generals and Match Group over Google’s app store policies. “We plan to challenge the verdict,” Wilson White, Google vice president for government affairs and public policy, said in a statement. “Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles. We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem.” Sweeney does hope that some of Google’s deals revealed during the trial could give its partners leverage in negotiations. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo analysts cited the risk of partners striking harder bargains in exchange for carrying Google’s app store or using its billing system. However, investors don’t seem to be particularly worried that the result of this trial will threaten Google’s app business",error,513

I think when it comes to the phone, my sense is it’s going to be soft in China for the Sept. quarter,” Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster said on CNBC earlier this week. There’s some disagreement among analysts whether the Huawei competition is a temporary or permanent factor for Apple. “Importantly, we believe the data suggests increased competition from Huawei in China is likely to be a headwind next year,” Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang wrote in a note last month. Some reviews of this year’s new premium Huawei device suggest it is technologically inferior. “We expect Huawei-related pressure on iPhone to be temporary and moderate into FY24 due to significantly outdated chipset on the Mate 60 series,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang. During the quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported on new efforts from the Chinese government to ban foreign technology from government agencies, which many saw as a signal about the company’s changing fortunes in the region and raised the possibility that national pride or future government regulations could push Chinese consumers away from Apple. “With Huawei’s unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government’s ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,” wrote Citi analyst Atif Malik. In other regions, investors want to know if the iPhone 15 is selling like hotcakes, or if it’s not moving off store shelves as fast as previous years. Analysts call the strength of any given year’s iPhone sales the “cycle.” Apple launched new iPhones in September with a lighter, redesigned titanium body, a longer telephoto lens, and a USB-C charging port. “We are in the camp that [iPhone 15] is not a good cycle on demand weakness and elongation of replacement cycles,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote. While analysts track ship times on Apple’s website and third-party estimates for iPhone sales, there’s no substitute for color from Apple CEO Tim Cook or sales numbers, either from the week or so the iPhone 15 was on sale in September or through its unofficial guidance for the December quarter. Another factor is that some analysts are pointing to supply constraints on some iPhones, particularly the higher",error,513
179," for their films, these latest Thanksgiving entries will benefit not only from the freshness of their release, but also the ability of the talent to become involved in the promotion of their films as worthy and viable Oscar contenders.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Phoenix is no stranger to acting nominations at the big ceremony. He won best actor for his role in “Joker” during the 2020 Academy Awards and has previously been nominated for roles in Scott’s best picture winner, “Gladiator,” and later releases “Walk the Line” and “The Master.” Scott has earned three best director nominations for “Thelma & Louise” in 1992, “Gladiator” in 2001 and “Black Hawk Down” in 2002. His 2015 film “The Martian” was nominated for best picture. “Napoleon” could also be in contention for best production design, costume design, sound and editing. Box office analysts are also hopeful that the film will bring out the coveted adult moviegoing audience that has been slower to return to theaters. The film generated $3 million in Tuesday evening showings and is expected to tally around $22 million for the five-day Thanksgiving frame, which runs from Wednesday through Sunday. “Napoleon is an intriguing position with its marquee cast and director, a well-known historical figure, and a story that’s fit for the cinematic canvas,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst BoxOffice.com. “It arrives as older segments of the adult audience remain part of a challenging equation for Hollywood to solve. Some clear successes have shown that those moviegoers will prioritize theatrical viewings, but it’s more quality-and content-driven than ever before.” Universal’s “Oppenheimer” is a prime example of a film for mature audiences, based on real events, that was able to capture audience attention. The film generated more than $300 million domestically during its run in theaters and tallied more than $950 million globally. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film was billed as a must-see picture on the big screen, driving moviegoers across demographics out to cinemas. “Napoleon” likely won’t reach the lofty heights of “Oppenheimer,” but it doesn’t have to.

193," supposed to charge [days earlier], until also that night.” A spokesperson at Merchant Advisory Group, which works with more than 150 merchants across the U.S., said it’s not unusual for businesses to develop systems that help them minimize the transaction costs imposed by card networks. Starbucks, for instance, has a rewards program that incentivizes customers who pay with a Starbucks gift card by awarding two “stars” for every $1 spent, as opposed to one star if they were to pay with a credit or debit card.  “It’s really the same process, just a different way of making that process work.” That said, Apple’s practice is unique among major app stores. Asked about the practice, an Apple spokesperson told CNBC in an emailed statement that the company sometimes bundles multiple purchases and subscriptions into one bill for the convenience of its customers, and sends a single email receipt instead of an individual email for every purchase a customer makes. It also notes the practice on its website in the support section on how to confirm billing charges. Apple did not respond to follow-up requests to clarify how it determines the duration of a delayed charge and when it decides to group purchases. Meanwhile, Google Play does not bundle, a company spokesperson told CNBC. Its website says that customers are charged “shortly” after purchasing content and will receive a confirmation email with their order information.  An Amazon spokesperson said purchases on Amazon Appstore are treated separately and a “separate clear” notification is sent to the customer for each charge. There are likely financial advantages for Apple in bundling and delaying charges, some experts say. Businesses have to pay a per-transaction fee — or “swipe fee” — each time they process an electronic payment. The swipe fee is typically a percentage of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee. Credit card swipe fees average 2.24% but can be as high as 4%, according to the Merchants Payment Coalition. The Federal Reserve capped debit card fees at 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction.  By delaying a charge so it can be grouped with other purchases, Apple may be able to retain a larger profit margin. Delayed and bundled charges were more comprehensible in the early days of the iTunes Music Store because charging a customer each time they purchased a $0.99 song would have been coupled with steep interchange fees, said Barnard, the developer. But the practice made less sense with the emergence of the App",error,513
193," Store in 2008. Bundling could have cost-cutting perks for the customer, said Lawrence Sprung, a certified financial planner and the founder of Mitlin Financial in Hauppauge, New York. Since Apple can save on transaction fees by grouping purchases, he said it’s also likely that customers can pay less for those purchases. “If the company can keep their cost down, then the hope is that they’ll keep the cost down for the consumer,” Sprung said. When a customer isn’t billed immediately after a purchase, it can drive them to make more purchases, according to psychology experts. Bundled billing can reduce “pain of paying,” which refers to the negative emotions people experience when paying for goods or services, said consumer psychologist Michael Barbera, chief behavioral officer at Clicksuasion Labs. If a customer receives a receipt or notification after every purchase they make, they’ll be less likely to spend money in the future.   “When we swipe our credit card or make a purchase, we’re happy,” Barbera said. “We enjoy buying stuff, we just don’t like seeing the transaction.” So, when customers can indulge in an app or service without being billed on the spot, they’re more likely to associate their interactions with Apple as experiential rather than transactional, said Barbera — and that positively influences consumer behavior. The practice of bundling charges and the lack of clarity on how the policy is executed create the illusion that customers are spending less money less often, said Avigail Lev, a clinical psychologist and consultant based in San Francisco. That can lead to overspending — especially for people who aren’t the best at tracking expenses. The financial consequences of bundled billing may also disproportionately affect people who live paycheck to paycheck, said behavioral scientist Piyush Tantia, chief innovation officer at Ideas42. Those individuals tend to have volatile income and expenses that make it difficult for them to track their finances thoroughly.  “They’re not accounting for that charge hitting later, and they may spend [the money] on something else in the meantime and then end up with hefty fees,” Tantia said. “For someone who’s already tight on finances, that extra fee is very, very painful.” As Apple user Moore discovered, bundled billing can be more problematic for shoppers using debit cards.

It would have been a “big loss of confidence” if Meta stopped investing heavily to push the VR market forward, said Aneesh Kulkarni, chief technology officer of the VR training firm Strivr. “Meta is pushing the bar, and who has the money to push the bar?” Kulkarni said. He added that while $2 billion of app store sales “may not sound like a lot compared to the Apple store,” it’s a big and important number. Apple has a giant marketplace — $1.1 trillion in developer billings and sales in 2022 — because of the popularity of iPhone and iPad apps. Josette Seitz, a mixed-reality developer for the social impact company Baltu Technologies, said Apple could have an advantage courting businesses that already use its products, like those that employ iPads to help conduct maintenance and other related services. A company that currently supplies field workers with iPads for inspections or similar tasks could conceivably make the easy transition to the more immersive Vision Pro because of the devices’ interoperability, she said. At its high price point, the Vision Pro will likely be more of a product for businesses, Seitz said. Regardless, it’s important to have more entrants in the market. “There shouldn’t just be one company,” she said. “We can’t have this be a monopoly system.” Gaspar Ferreiro, a developer with the VR firm Coal Car Studios, called the Vision Pro’s price “insane” and said Apple is taking a “big gamble.” “Enterprises will absolutely take the gamble,” Ferreiro said, noting some businesses will splurge on Apple devices because of the company’s reputation and prestige. Meta still faces its own challenges. The company has struggled to bring VR into the mainstream despite a yearslong head start, and Ferreiro isn’t sure that the Quest 3′s improvements over the Quest 2, which is $200 cheaper, will be enough to win new customers who aren’t industry insiders or developers. “The general consumer is probably going to be faced with a conundrum, do I spend another $200",error,513
198," on this other device?” Ferreiro said. One of the Quest 3′s biggest improvements over the previous version is its so-called “passthrough” feature, which converts a person’s field of vision into a digital format, thus allowing computer visuals to be overlaid on to the physical world. Looking at physical surroundings using the Quest 2 proved to be a blurry experience that lacked color, but with the Quest 3 it’s much clearer and should be more enjoyable to use. For developers, Ferreiro said, that translates into the ability to create more compelling content and visually attractive experiences that integrate the physical and digital worlds. Jeffrey Morin, CEO of the Litesport VR fitness service, said the Quest 3 is priced “just outside of my comfort zone for, like, me buying my kid a Christmas gift.” But he agrees that improved passthrough is very valuable and was crucial for the company’s upcoming mixed-reality app it created for Xponential Fitness that will let users work out with real personal trainers who can be virtually beamed into their living rooms. As far as working with Apple, Morin said Litesport will look for ways to develop for the Vision Pro as it evolves and the price potentially drops to between $1,000 to $1,500 in the future. Initially, the price is too high and the Vision Pro will require users to wear a battery pack, creating an added nuisance during a workout. The advantage Apple offers is a base of customers who “are going to be way more likely to pay for a subscription,” providing a recurring source of revenue, he said. Based on Morin’s experience thus far, most current Quest users are gamers who are more accustomed to making one-time app purchases. Morin said that even though Apple’s product isn’t out yet, he noticed an increase in the number of people using Litesports’ VR fitness apps once it was announced, underscoring the VR community’s overall excitement. “They fired up their headsets and they’re, like, let me see what’s out there again,” Morin said. Ultimately, Apple’s move into VR is proof that it’s not just an ambitious Facebook side project. “It’s not like Mark’s little toy anymore,” Morin said. “Now it’s everyone’s",error,513
199," is basically silence.” DuckDuckGo executives returned to Cupertino the following summer for another meeting and presented visuals of how the product would look once its search engine was integrated into Apple services. Weinberg said his “impression was that they were really serious” about the idea “potentially for the next year’s release.” He said that Adler asked them “to come back basically as soon as possible to brainstorm what privacy integrations could look like.” Separate recently unsealed testimony from Apple’s side tells a somewhat different story. John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence and a former Google executive, joined the company in 2018. He testified that he wasn’t aware of Apple considering the search default switch. Still, he went on to describe discussions with other Apple executives about the potential drawbacks of such a proposal. Giannandrea worried DuckDuckGo’s “marketing about privacy is somewhat incongruent with the details,” since he thought the company would have to share some user information with Microsoft due to its arrangement to receive search information from Bing.  DuckDuckGo says in its privacy policy that it prevents “our hosting and content providers from creating a history of your searches and browsing.” In September 2018, DuckDuckGo returned to Apple headquarters to discuss integration, Weinberg testified. Apple “expressed they were really considering this for the 2019 release,” and Weinberg then realized they still had some lingering concerns. In particular, Apple realized it need to figure out how to resolve issues tied to its Google contract, Weinberg testified. Sometime after the 2018 holidays, DuckDuckGo received documentation from Apple showing what its revenue share would be if it were the default. DuckDuckGO estimated its market share “would increase multiple times over” just by becoming the default in private browsing mode. By the summer of 2019, DuckDuckGo began to understand the partnership would not happen. Apple didn’t announce the integration during its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Four months later, following a meeting, Weinberg’s takeaway was that the deal was “dead.” DuckDuckGo had also pitched Samsung, Mozilla and Opera on being the default option in their private browsing modes, but was not able to reach a deal with any of them. The company eventually stopped pursuing this model because it",error,513
200,", he worked on Search at Google. Much of his testimony revolved around internal deliberations at Apple to improve Siri and Spotlight, both of which can funnel queries to Google when they don’t have a ready answer. The DOJ sought to show that Apple may have invested more heavily in its own search technology if it didn’t have a lucrative deal with Google. Giannandrea said he didn’t think Apple had a “general” search engine because it does not have a search results page, but that it competes for queries through its Siri, Spotlight, and auto-complete “Suggestions” in the Safari browser, which can answer questions using Apple’s technology before sending the question to Google. He said the company had not made a decision on whether to build its own general search engine, which would be an expensive undertaking. Giannandrea added he believed that Cook had met with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in the summer of 2018, which kicked off internal talks about whether Apple should increase its partnership with Bing. He explained he and Apple’s head of business development, Adrian Perica, had two or three meetings with Microsoft that year, starting in August. “I would say that there was an open discussion about whether we could do more together, and that included, my understanding was, potentially the option to acquire Bing from Microsoft,” Giannandrea said, according to the transcript. Microsoft had also suggested that it might be willing to be “very flexible” with sharing revenue from its ads in the event of a partnership, Giannandrea said. The proposed revenue-share proportion is redacted in the transcript seen by CNBC. “I think we had a series of meetings in response to this initial meeting with Microsoft to talk about advertising generally and what Apple’s strategy was there,” Giannandrea said. He also mentioned that Cook had asked about revenue growth from the Google deal slowing down in August 2018, and he said that the primary driver of the revenue share with Google would be “the number of queries that were sent to Google.” Microsoft was interested in Apple paying for improvements to the search engine, Giannandrea said, including expanding it to additional international markets. “One of the four options we looked at was a joint venture where Apple would have presumably provided some resources and they would have done some of these projects,” Giannandrea said. Giannandrea suggested several times",error,513
201," of September. Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California at Berkeley, said Apple deserves to be celebrated for the significant emissions reductions it achieved in changing its operations, but Haya also said she wishes Apple had avoided the term “carbon neutral” in its communications about its work. She argues consumers would be better served by Apple publicly bragging about its 78% emissions reductions instead of trying to tell consumers that their product is actually “carbon neutral.” Even if the carbon credits Apple buys are of the highest quality, carbon credits are, by their very nature, an accounting strategy. There are 22% of emissions that Apple could not abate, and Haya commends Apple on that transparency. “If you buy an Apple Watch, your emissions are not zero,” Haya told CNBC, a fact that Apple acknowledges. The way to have no environmental impact is to not generate those emissions in the first place. “Fossil fuels are permanently in the ground if you don’t draw them out and burn them,” Haya told CNBC. The most important work Apple did in launching its “carbon neutral” watch is to drive down the emissions that are associated with making its watch, according to everyone CNBC talked to for this story. Here are some specific examples of how Apple has worked to reduce actual emissions associated with making its “carbon neutral” watch: Apple ought to be respected for these accomplishments, Sturcken at EDF told CNBC. Sturcken has been at EDF for almost 27 years, leading partnerships with companies such as Airbnb, FedEx, Lyft, UPS and Walmart to reduce the emissions of their supply chains. EDF does not take money from the companies it works with, and Sturcken has not worked with Apple on its “carbon neutral” watch. Broadly speaking, though, Sturcken said, Apple is doing good work in its sustainability efforts. “They’re a leader,” Sturcken said. “They have a whole team. They get it. They’re focusing on the right things, in general.” To compensate for the 22% of unabated residual emissions, Apple invests in what it deems to be high-quality carbon credits that restore grasslands, wetlands and forests.

Current projects are in Brazil and Paraguay and will restore 150,000 acres of forests and protect another 100,000 acres of forests, grasslands and wetlands. The criticism of these kinds of forestry projects is that their climate mitigation impact is less permanent than the climate impact of releasing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere to begin with. “Apple relies on credits from carbon dioxide removal projects that restore forest, wetlands, and grasslands. Due to natural or human-induced disturbances such as forest fires, land degradation or land-use change, carbon storage in forestry and land-use projects is likely to only be temporary, and therefore in no way comparable with not having emitted greenhouse gases in the first place,” Reena Skribbe, a sustainable development expert at the nonprofit organization NewClimate Institute, told CNBC. “The environmental integrity of carbon credits from carbon dioxide removals cannot be assured, thus carbon credits cannot be seen as a substitute to emission reductions,” Skribbe told CNBC. Apple says the carbon credits it is investing in are carefully monitored, measured and tracked. “We’re here to do the right work, not that easy work,” Sarah Chandler, Apple’s vice president of environment and supply chain innovation, told CNBC. “There are certainly wonderful nature-based carbon removal projects, and there are ones that are not as wonderful. And it is important to draw distinctions between the two and be very clear about the projects.” What makes this debate more nuanced is that carbon credits can combat deforestation, and stopping deforestation is mission critical to meeting global climate goals, Sturcken told CNBC. “Stopping deforestation is blaringly urgent right now,” Sturcken said. Planting new trees is helpful, “but more urgent than anything is stopping deforestation, because it takes so long for new trees to grow. And if we don’t do that, in the near term, we have a much harder road to get to a climate-stable future. So anything we can do to incentivize in a robust and high integrity way, that kind of investment by companies we should be doing.” So, too, says Michael Ackerman, CEO of EcoForests Asset Management, a company that coordinates forestry investment in Latin America. He said carbon markets are right now “the wild, wild west,” as other disruptive industries such as bitcoin and social media have been. And from his",error,513

CNBC went to Arm’s headquarters in Cambridge, England, to find out how it became the year’s biggest IPO despite struggling smartphone sales and geopolitical uncertainty. Arm was founded in 1990 by 12 chip designers working out of a turkey barn in Cambridge. It was originally a joint venture between Apple, Acorn Computers, and VLSI, which is now part of NXP. Arm’s big break came in 1993, when Apple launched its early handheld Newton device on the Arm610 processor. Haas said this gets at the “hallmarks” of the company. “We were born running a device off a battery that was going to be low cost,” he said.  That same year, Arm struck a deal with Texas Instruments, putting its processors in early Nokia mobile phones and beginning Arm’s climb to become the dominant smartphone architecture it is today. Arm went public for the first time in 1998. Chief architect Richard Grisenthwaite was there. “We were about 100 people, and I’ve been very much involved in this tremendous transition that the company has gone through, expanding out from being targeting one particular market area into a wide range of different computing environments,” Grisenthwaite said. Indeed, Arm grew rapidly in the 2000s, with the first touchscreen phones introduced in 2007 and the growth of connected home devices in the 2010s. Arm now has some 6,500 employees globally. Grisenthwaite said the majority of those employees are in the UK, and about a sixth are in the U.S., where Arm has offices in Arizona, California, North Carolina and Texas. It also has locations in Norway, Sweden, France and India. In 2016, Arm once again became a private company when Japan’s SoftBank acquired it for $32 billion. Haas was president of the IP products group at the time, spearheading diversification into emerging markets, including AI. “PC and phone, automotive, data center and IoT. Those are the primary markets that we address. Every single one of those markets has AI embedded in some way, shape or form,” he said. Arm has some 6,800 patents worldwide, with another 2,700 applications pending. Some of those are for Arm’s Neoverse line for high-performance and",error,513
205," cloud computing, which has helped it break into AI since its launch in 2018. In August, Nvidia announced its latest Grace Hopper Superchip, which couples its own GPUs with Arm’s Neoverse cores.  “By bringing those together and tightly coupling the way that Nvidia has with the Grace Hopper, they’re able to come up with something that’s something like 2 to 4 times the performance of what you’d get on an x86 system for a similar amount of power,” Grisenthwaite explained. If you rewind just a couple years, Nvidia’s interest in Arm went far beyond technology integration. Arm owner Softbank needed cash after losing money on high-profile investments in companies like WeWork and Uber. In 2020, SoftBank struck a deal with Nvidia to sell Arm for $40 billion. Eighteen months later, the deal fell apart, blocked by regulators and some of Arm’s biggest customers, which also compete with Nvidia. Haas said he was, “Disappointed it didn’t happen just because we spent so much time on it.” Instead, Softbank announced plans to take Arm public again and Haas took over as CEO. Arm made its second public debut this September, climbing nearly 25% that day. The stock has fallen significantly since then. One risk comes from a free, open-source rival architecture called RISC-V. It’s seen a recent surge in backing from some of Arm’s big customers like Google, Samsung and Qualcomm, which may have been seeking alternatives when it looked like Nvidia was going to buy Arm. For now, RISC-V remains a low risk competitor according to Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. “RISC-V sits a few years behind where Arm is at, and I don’t think we’re going to hear a lot about it right away. I do think in low power, in IoT, in simpler designs, that RISC-V does have some traction,” Newman said. Arm’s bigger competition comes from x86. Developed by Intel in the 70s, x86 is the dominant architecture used for PC processors, with a massive amount of software developed for it. “The amount of software support is the thing that actually tends to determine the success or failure of that in the long run. Intel was very good early on with getting a ton of software support for x86,” O",error,513
205,"’Donnell explained.  Most servers have also traditionally been based on x86, but O’Donnell said that could shift. “What’s happened in the server market is that the software has been componentized. It’s broken up into containers and things like that, and that makes it easier to run on other architectures like Arm,” he said. Amazon Web Services is a big player making Arm-based server chips. AWS launched its Graviton chips to rival x86 CPUs from AMD and Intel in 2018. “And really from there, Arm went from this mobile, low power IoT, automotive specialty embedded to holy cow, we can build next generation servers, PCs, and of course continue on this massive run of silicon for smartphones, all based on Arm,” Newman said. Apple is the big partner helping Arm break into the laptop market. Apple moved to its own Arm-based processors in Mac computers in 2020, breaking away from the Intel x86 processors that had powered them for 15 years. In October, Apple announced its latest line of M3 processors and the MacBooks and iMacs running on them. Apple said Arm-based M3 gives the newest MacBook up to 22 hours of battery life.  “Nobody really believed, until Apple went all in and basically cut ties with x86 instruction sets and said, ‘We are going to bet the future of the Mac on Arm.’ And that was a huge inflection for the company. It was a change of the guard. And this isn’t to say that Intel’s future is in big trouble, but it certainly started to raise some question marks as to, well, if Apple can do it, can others?” Newman said. In September, Apple extended its deal with Arm through at least 2040.  Qualcomm is another major customer making its latest PC processors using Arm, although that relationship is strained. Arm is suing Qualcomm over the right to make certain chips with its technology. The issues started after Qualcomm acquired CPU company Nuvia in 2021, and with it, Nuvia’s Arm license. “Nuvia was actually supposed to be designing a server chip initially, so they had different terms with them. And so Qualcomm thought they could have the same terms. Arm felt no, different companies have different terms. And it’s boiled down to essentially that: legal discussions around what those terms ought to be,” O’Donnell explained. The case",error,513
205," is set to go to trial in 2024. Arm is also growing in the automotive space. Although its chips have long been in cars, it’s now a rapid growth area with the rise of self-driving capabilities and partnerships with companies like Cruise. Arm’s Grisenthwaite calls self-driving “one of the most computationally intensive tasks we’ve ever seen on this planet.”“What we need to provide is a standard platform to allow the world’s software developers to really concentrate on this incredibly hard task going forward,” he said. This simplification is also making Arm the choice for non-chip companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft designing their own custom silicon. “They’ve got a smaller team than entire companies built on that. And so you have to make that process easier and simpler. And that, for example, is where Arm is starting to move in terms of enabling the design of multiple components that connect together,” O’Donnell said. Although more companies are making inroads into semiconductor design, the recent chip shortage exposed major concern over the fact that more than 90% of the world’s chips are manufactured in Asia.  Now China and the U.S. are going back and forth imposing export controls on chip technologies. For now, Arm says it’s seen minimal impact from the export controls. “What we do is obviously comply with all kinds of export regulations whenever they come out. Of course we comply. China is a good market for us: about 20% of our business. It’s shifted over the years. It used to be largely mobile phone based. Now it’s mostly around the data center and automotive,” Haas said. In 2018, SoftBank broke off Arm’s China business into an independent entity, Arm China, that’s majority owned by a group of Chinese investors. Haas explained further, “It’s essentially to allow us to not only grow our business in China, which is our essentially base core business. We set up a distributor arm, but at the same time, we also created an R&D arm that allows an independent entity to develop products specifically for the China market, some that are Arm based but some that are not Arm based.” Arm China has also been embroiled in controversy, with SoftBank and Arm trying to oust the CEO of the China business, Allen Wu. Despite being fired,",error,513

We tend to announce things as they come to market, and that’s our MO, and I’d like to stick to that.” To that point, the latest iPhone and Watch models showcase Apple’s AI prowess. The iPhone 15 features several AI technologies, such as personal voice, which lets users synthesize a voice like their own so they can speak words they type in FaceTime and phone calls, and live voicemail, a real-time transcription of messages. The upgraded camera uses machine-learning AI to tell the difference between a person and an animal in the frame. The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 incorporate AI into the double-tap feature to more easily perform tasks, a brighter display, smarter Siri and advanced health monitoring. AI will also be built into Vision Pro, especially its integration with FaceTime, Apple said in announcing the headset, which it calls a spatial computer. Users will be able to create avatars of themselves via machine-learning techniques, allowing them to do things together like watch a movie, browse photos or collaborate on a presentation. Still, the progress app by app and device by device has not protected Apple from criticism that it’s already late to the game. Laura Martin, a tech analyst at Needham, is among those who say Apple is “far behind” its big tech rivals. “The future is generative AI and Apple isn’t doing that,” she said. Even so, Martin added, “I’m not sure it matters, because they have an ecosystem, an economic model” that is geared toward machine-learning. “Apple’s ecosystem is fine and will keep growing,” she said. The early edge in generative AI is paying off for rivals, as was evidenced by Microsoft’s recent earnings report. But the one advantage Apple has that its tech rivals don’t: the world’s most monetized installed base, more than two billion users running its iOS operating software on devices. That’s why bullish analysts don’t see the competition for Apple as being straight up against the generative AI platforms being pursued by Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Comparisons being made today to the first wave of cloud adoption – and generative AI ecosystems now being referred to by some as Cloud 2.0 – are a good place to",error,513
214," look at why it may be less a race than parallel development process. Even as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and to a lesser extent Google Cloud, gobbled up market share as more enterprises migrated to cloud-based computing, Apple made no play for that market.  “They wont look at AI from the outside looking in. They will be big player in AI even though the perception is they are late to the game,” Ives said. “We believe they are on the cusp of what will be the introduction of an AI App Store over the next year,” he said. Last week, Bloomberg reported that in a race to “catch up” Apple would spend $1 billion a year on generative AI. Ives says he believes that’s a significant under-estimate of the amount Apple will spend, and already has been spending, on AI. He expects Apple to spend as much as $5 billion a year on AI and says it already has spent $10 billion on AI research & development in the past few years to create the foundation for developers to build AI apps – a level that would be comparable to Microsoft’s spending. “That’s the holy grail for them, the AI App Store. That’s where they can monetize in a historic way,” Ives said. It’s a growth opportunity that would leverage what’s been one of the most important aspects of the Apple story in recent years, the growth of its services business, which is now a $100 billion revenue stream on its own. Within an AI App Store, the opportunities can range far beyond core Apple offerings like Music, to a wide variety of health and fitness apps, for example, and in the end offer an additional $5 billion to $10 billion a year in services revenue, by Ives’ count. Cook’s single mention of generative AI to analysts helped fuel speculation as to just what Apple will — or won’t — do in that highly competitive field, led by Microsoft’s involvement with OpenAI and ChatGPT and its own Bing AI chatbot, Google’s Bard bot and Meta’s LLM-based virtual assistant, Meta AI. In July, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on AI tools to challenge those bots with its own LLM, dubbed Ajax, and has created a chatbot, Apple GPT, for internal use. In August, the Financial Times",error,513
226," a fit with Apple, which appeals to consumers around the world. Still, it’s not clear Apple would have any interest in buying Disney. Beyond its treatment of M&A as anathema, Apple has no core competency running theme parks or selling the kinds of consumer products Disney offers. It almost certainly wouldn’t want to be in the dying cable television business. While Apple has dabbled in owning sports rights and creating scripted content for Apple TV+, the businesses are so small relative to making and selling devices that they’re essentially non-material to the company. Apple hasn’t bothered to tell investors the number of Apple TV+ subscribers. On one hand, buying Disney would supercharge those fledging businesses, which could help with Apple device churn while growing subscription revenue. On the other, if Apple wants to spend more than $100 billion on an acquisition, getting an ESPN business with shrinking subscribers and a content business centered around streaming, which currently loses money, may not be its deal of choice. Apple could buy Disney to make content for its augmented reality headset, potentially the company’s next major growth division, but that’s probably not enough of a reason to make an acquisition. Even if Apple CEO Tim Cook fell in love with the notion of owning Disney and its associated perks (free Disney World rides for Apple employees! Content synergies for device owners!), it’s ambiguous at best, and unlikely at worst, whether regulators would allow a deal to proceed. With Lina Khan running the Federal Trade Commission, which has tried to crack down on big tech acquisitions under her watch, the chances of the U.S. government allowing Apple to increase its dominance over the global economy seem minute. Perhaps Apple and Disney could sue to win approval — the businesses don’t have much overlap — but the process would be time-consuming and messy, bringing unneeded uncertainty to both companies. For the sake of argument, let’s say Apple does want to buy Disney. Let’s say Disney divests or sells its legacy cable assets, ridding itself of no-growth businesses that would weigh on Apple’s earnings. Let’s even say the regulatory environment changes so the U.S. government would be more amenable to a deal. An agreement would mean Disney’s corporate culture would have to blend with Apple’s culture. The Bob Chapek era at Disney illustrated the strength of Disney’s existing culture and showcased how changing",error,513

Zhao said he was planning to upgrade from his Huawei device to buy the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which has a list price of 9,999 yuan ($1,370). In early September, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that central government employees were ordered not to bring iPhones to the office or use them for work. It was not clear how new or wide-reaching any such order was. Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the situation, also reported a ban on iPhones at work could spread to other state-affiliated agencies. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country hadn’t issued bans on the purchase or use of Apple iPhones. Apple did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on the reports or its iPhone 15 sales in China. Shares of Apple, the largest U.S. stock by market capitalization, are down by about 7% so far this month. Apples’ iPhone 15 pre-sales in China pointed to robust demand. Earlier this week, CNBC checks of online shopping sites JD.com and Alibaba’s Tmall showed the more expensive iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max were essentially sold out, with delivery wait times of about a month or more. “Based on the current pre-ordering results, we do see that Apple will still be resilient in its sales, though it faces challenges like Huawei’s new products and the absence of the usual buzz on China’s social media,” said Will Wong, senior researcher at IDC, a market research firm. “We are expecting a 5%-6% YoY growth for Apple’s overall shipments” in China in the second half of this year, he said. However, he noted pre-order results don’t necessarily represent the final sales number and that last year, China was still dealing with Covid-19. Consumers living outside big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou also wanted to buy the new iPhone. Orders from less developed cities surged by six times versus last year, according to Dada. China accounts for nearly 20% of Apple’s revenue.

The firm’s worst-case scenario predicts a 15% year-on-year decline. “We must acknowledge the existence of initial supply constraints, particularly for the Pro series. This has manifested in longer delivery times for pre-orders over the past two days,” Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said in an email Wednesday. “If these supply issues persist without a prompt resolution, it would necessitate us leaning towards the bearish case.” Pathak noted that Huawei’s decline allowed the iPhone to “attract a massive number of consumers” in the $600-plus price category, and said iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users would likely want to upgrade to the iPhone 15. The firm said iPhone 15 pre-sales on JD.com exceeded 3 million units. JD.com did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. However, Shanghai-based CINNO Research had a more pessimistic outlook as of Wednesday: A 22% drop in overall iPhone 15 unit sales versus that of the iPhone 14 in China.

228,", Cue said he needed to meet with Pichai “alone next week and agree to the economic terms or we shouldn’t move forward,” referring to the revenue sharing number. But Cue said on the stand Tuesday that he was confident a deal would get worked out with Google and that he hadn’t seriously contemplated what Apple would do if it didn’t. “Certainly there wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to,” Cue testified. “It’s not something that we ever really truly considered.” Ultimately, Cue said he felt it was in the best interests of both companies to finalize a deal. Cue said the two sides agreed to a revenue sharing percentage that was different from the number each presented initially. The terms of the deal were renewed in 2021 to extend the contract. The DOJ asked whether there was a provision in the agreement for Apple to support and defend the deal in connection to government actions. Cue confirmed there was but that he didn’t know a lot about it. At the time, Cue said, Google had requested the addition while it was under investigation in Europe, and Apple’s counsel had said it was fine to include. The DOJ also asked Cue to detail how Apple decides where and how it will give consumers a choice about the setup of their iPhones. One alternative Google competitors have floated to its default status on devices is to give consumers a chance to review their search engine options in a way that presents them equally. Cue’s testimony spoke to some of the challenges that approach could face. He said that when consumers get a new device, they want it to work quickly. “The more choices or the more options that you get, it frustrates customers,” he said. So when a customer gets a new iPhone, for example, they’ll only be asked about choosing key details they want to deal with right away, such as font size. Cue said offering users a choice for their appearance settings out of the box is different from selecting a search engine. In certain countries, such as China and Russia, Apple has carved out the default status for Google because it determined that there was a better option for consumers in those regions. But in other places around the world, the company still sees Google as offering the best experience, Cue said. In his testimony, Cue also reiterated criticism that Apple has when it comes to Google’s privacy practices. Cue said he agrees protecting privacy is important to Apple,",error,513
237," Apple’s new iPhones couldn’t silence stocks’ September slump. Shares of the most valuable company in the world sank 1.7% after Apple’s announcement. That’s not really something to worry about. Apple’s shares have tended to slip after announcing new products, but that’s usually a one-day hangover. In other words, yesterday’s fall is less a reflection of investor interest in the company — Apple’s one of those immovable bedrocks of the American stock market, at least for the past decade — than the current mood in markets. Indeed, all of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks retreated yesterday, CNBC’s Scott Schnipper noted. While not part of the vaunted group, Oracle shares plummeted 13.5%. That’s its worst performance since 2002, after posting disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings Monday.   “Oracle, which isn’t a super large stock, but it is a look into the spending of businesses — and larger businesses at that — disappointed today, and that’s one of the factors that are suppressing both the NASDAQ and the S&P,” said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital Partners. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.04%, snapping a two-day winning streak, while the S&P 500 declined 0.57%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.05%. Investors looking for a silver lining in September can seek solace in noted investors’ and analysts’ calls.

It’s true 4,500 isn’t that’s not far off from the index’s close of 4,461.

240," company’s most intriguing product lines in terms of a look at the future of computing, even if they don’t get the same attention as the iPhone. While the adaptive technology isn’t quite seamless yet, it is a nice improvement over the blunter, muffling noise-cancellation setting that used to be the default on AirPods Pro. And it’s not only limited to the latest hardware — anyone with “second generation” AirPods Pro introduced last September can download software updates for their headphones and iPhone to enable them. The new Adaptive mode ultimately blends chaotic street noise with the artificial quiet of active noise cancellation. Apple frames Adaptive Audio as a safety feature, so users don’t miss honks or disturbances when walking around cities. It’s subtle. You definitely feel like you’re still in a cocoon of quiet, but you don’t feel as if the whole world is muffled around you. There’s a little chime when users turn it on, either through the Settings app when the earbuds are connected or through a shortcut by long-pressing the iPhone’s volume button in the Control Center. In practice, Adaptive Audio wasn’t perfect, but it’s an improvement over active noise canceling, which can be very isolating, and Apple’s transparency mode, which often amplifies extraneous noise (like the AirPods case clicking against car keys in my pocket). If I were to walk around cities, which I try to avoid for safety reasons, I would use Apple’s Adaptive mode. But Bay Area BART station announcements made over a central speaker were still muffled, especially when I was listening to music, and that’s the sort of information I would like to hear. I still needed to turn off the headphones or take them out if I wanted to understand what they were saying, such as which train was coming into the station. When walking in a dog park separated from a highway by a sound wall, Adaptive Audio let in more highway noise than active-cancellation mode, which wasn’t optimal. Later, when another person in the park was arguing about something and making a scene, I didn’t catch it by hearing it in Adaptive mode — I saw the dispute first. While many people use noise-canceling headphones to zone out those kind of disturbances, from a safety perspective",error,513
240,", that’s something urban dwellers should be aware of in their vicinity. Another key scenario for noise-canceling headphones is in the workplace, where workers who are headed back to the office are increasingly using them to try to simulate home office-like privacy or signal to co-workers they can’t talk. It’s here where the Conversation Awareness feature will shine, allowing office grinders to hold quick conversations without taking out their AirPods. The feature effectively turns down your music or audio when it senses you’re taking part in a conversation. Instead of fumbling in settings to turn noise-canceling off or turn off the music, or taking the earbuds out of your ears, the software does it for you, and even amplifies the conversation a little bit. When it works, it’s great. I had a couple conversations with my wife with the AirPods in and Conversation Awareness on. We spoke as if I didn’t have $250 of technology in my ears, and when I went back to doing what I was doing before, the volume of my music automatically went back to normal levels. But there’s one big catch to Conversation Awareness — it doesn’t engage when someone talks to you, it only starts when you open your mouth and say something. So I found myself missing the first thing that was said in several conversations, such as when a neighbor greeted me, or what the cashier said when I approached my favorite taco truck. At the taco truck, I found myself regretting not taking out the AirPods. I did feel like I missed a little bit of context in the short exchange, and felt rude for keeping in my headphones. I heard and understood the key bits, such as the total price, but I did not feel it was the same real-time conversation as if I was just speaking without headphones. Also, Conversation Awareness did not turn down my music five minutes later when the cashier called out my order for pickup. Ultimately, my order was wrong too, probably because I was distracted. But it’s easy to see how people will use the feature to order a cold brew without pausing their music. There are other little quirks, too. I like to sing along to music when I’m alone. With Conversation Awareness on, the music gets turned down, leaving you to hear your own flat singing. Once, when I was working at my computer, I laughed, and the Air",error,513
241," most obvious button. When you do it on your watch face, by default, it brings up a new scrolling screen of widgets with weather, Apple News headlines, and calendar appointments. The tap motion also stops alarms, ends phone calls, and can even trigger the iPhone’s shutter button, depending on which Watch app you’re using. The most useful example is when you start a workout — a run, or a long walk — and forget to start it on the watch. The device often picks up that you’re working out and asks if you want to log the workout. Now, instead of tapping on the device’s screen, you can just raise your watch and double tap to start the workout. In testing, I didn’t find the double tap to be an indispensable daily gesture for me, although it was fun to play around with, and the haptic feedback when it works is satisfying. Nor did I find the “smart stack” widget that the double tap brings up to be that useful — I generally don’t like widgets, and the suggestions it made by default were not helpful, like a card with tips for my new Apple Watch. The individual widgets are selected through machine learning, so it could get better with use. The gesture also requires the Apple Watch interface to be activated, with its backlight on. You can’t just double tap when your arm is at your side. Instead, you have to raise your arm to wake the display first, then tap your fingers twice, which makes it feel like a much more exaggerated motion. In an interesting twist, the “double tap” is a nearly identical gesture to the main way to select things on the Vision Pro, Apple’s VR headset that’s coming out next year. Apple has framed that device as a “new era for computing” based on its user interface, a concept it calls “spatial computing.” The Vision Pro uses sophisticated sensors detect hand motions and other gestures, allowing the user to interact with it in 3D space, rather than simply by tapping a screen. The new Apple Watch gives a glimpse into that world. From a pure technology perspective, it shows that as Apple introduces its version of mixed reality through its headset, it will also be bringing parts of that user interface to its other products that already ship in the tens of millions. Double tap won’t be on by default with the Watches going on sale Friday. Instead, it",error,513

The other big improvement in this year’s watches is an updated central chip, which Apple calls a System-in-Package, or SiP. It has 60% more transistors, according to Apple, and a 30% faster GPU. The old Apple Watches always seemed responsive enough to me, and the chip doesn’t make the watch immediately feel snappier, but it’s the first major update to the Watch’s processor in a number of years. Most notably, it enables a much faster Siri which doesn’t need to be connected to the internet. Now, when you give a voice command to your watch, your command is processed on the device, from translating it from spoken word to text to understanding what it’s asking for. If Siri doesn’t need to connect to the internet, the whole command can happen without a cellular or WiFi connection. The main thing I noticed is that on-device Siri feels much quicker when responding. In the past, I’ve avoided using my Apple Watch as a Siri interface because I found commands can time out with a weak Wi-Fi connection. I found myself preferring my Apple Watch over a HomePod or my phone for simple tasks like setting a kitchen timer, or quick questions like finding out when a particular game is on TV. The on-device processing also allows Siri to access your health data, which Apple typically protects by default. Siri on the watch couldn’t do things like log weight through a voice command or tell you whether you took your medications because it had to be sent to the cloud for processing. On-device Siri will be very convenient for people who need to check a vital stat or log data on a daily basis. The other big hardware improvement to the Apple Watch Series 9 is a brighter display. Apple says the new models can go up to 2000 nits of brightness, versus 1000 for last year’s models. In indoors environments, like a home or office, the brighter display won’t be particularly noticeable. Where you can notice it is outdoors, in direct sunlight, where the brighter panel on the new devices pops a little bit more, and makes text, especially in white, slightly more solid-looking. Apple Watches don’t allow the user to choose a specific brightness level, but instead offer one",error,513
242," and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren’t included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips.  Cook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to “an all-time record” fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. “So, the comparison point here is very difficult,” he said.  “I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We’ve got the M3, we’ve got the new products, and we don’t have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.   Cook added the overall market for personal computers is “challenging.”  Revenue from iPads was also down, falling 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.   Apple’s services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing more 16% from a year earlier.   Apple’s services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of the business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple’s browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year.  Cook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth.  “Every main service hit a record,” Cook said.   Maestri also noted in a statement that Apple’s installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although the company did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple’s installed base suggests future growth in its services division.   Cook said that Apple had over 1 billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple’s own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill",error,513
250," biggest change is expected to be a USB-C charging port, replacing Apple’s proprietary Lightning port, which was introduced in 2012 as the iPhone charger “for the next decade.” A USB-C charging port on iPhones will match the same charging port on Android phones, newer laptops, iPads, wireless headphones and other gadgets. The change is being spurred by new European regulations which require a common charging port. Apple is unlikely to mention that the change was required by a new law, but it will probably emphasize the positives for users, such as convenience and faster charging. It might also give the port a proprietary Apple marketing name. New Pro models could also get a titanium casing, replacing the stainless steel used in the past few models. Titanium is lighter than steel, reducing the phones’ total weight. Event invitations show an Apple logo in what looks like a titanium finish. Lower-end phones — expected to be called simply iPhone 15 — could get an upgrade to what the company calls the “dynamic island,” or a cutout that holds the phone’s facial recognition cameras toward the top of the screen. Last year’s Pro models ditched Apple’s “notch” for the undulating window, which can show real-time updates, such as how far away an Uber is or what’s playing on the music app. The mute switch, which has been present on iPhones for over a decade, could gain new functions as a customizable “action button.” Apple is also likely to focus on camera and chip improvements as reasons for the upgrade. The biggest and most expensive iPhone model, the bigger Pro, could get a new lens that can zoom with twice the strength as the 3x zoom lens on the iPhone 14 Pro, according to Bloomberg. One open question is whether Apple will raise price points. Some analysts think so, noting rising costs for parts like memory or processors. However, Apple did not raise U.S. iPhone prices last year under similar conditions. It does tweak its prices around the world regularly after launches and in response to currency fluctuations. Last year, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 8 and a new high-end titanium model called the Ultra in September. Both are likely to get updates this year, although Apple’s Watches don’t typically get as many major changes from year to year as the iPhones. Apple’s mainstream watches have had the same size and shape since 2018. The company is likely to upgrade the",error,513
253," The speakers on the device also have been improved, and provide a quality audio experience. Meta has also updated the two necessary controllers with better haptic feedback. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, which is Arm-based and closer in power and energy drain to a mobile processor than a PC processor. The extra power on the chip is used to power displays at 2,064 x 2,208 resolution per eye, higher than the Quest 2′s 1,832 x 1,920 resolution per eye. The additional pixels will make it easier to read text inside the headset. Users can expect about two hours and 12 minutes of battery life, Meta says. During the demo, I tried out Samba de Amigo, a $30 game from Sega that is like Dance Dance Revolution or Rock Band with maracas (in real life, the Quest 3 controllers). I enjoyed it, and even sweated a little bit. The biggest improvement to usability is that the Quest 3 emphasizes passthrough, which means the cameras outside the device can show live video on the displays inside the headset, working somewhat like a transparent pair of glasses that can also show computer windows and other graphics. The Quest 3 can also scan the room around you so apps can warn you when you’re about to bump into your surroundings. Passthrough, while a core component of mixed-reality experiences which integrate computer graphics with the real world, for now is a nice-to-have usability feature. In practice, it means that users can stop their game or experience inside the Quest 3 without taking the headset off. During the demo, I was able to chat with Meta officials while wearing the headset, a major improvement over the last version. Meta’s launch of the Quest 3 will be compared to Apple’s more expensive Vision Pro headset. But while Apple packed as much pricey technology into its headset as possible to enable its own passthrough mode it calls “spatial computing,” Meta is seeking to match many of its features, or at least an approximation of them, at a fraction of the price. Meta’s $1,499 Quest Pro is a lower-volume product. But if there’s one major difference between Meta and Apple at this point, it’s that the former envisions the Quest mainly as a gaming device, while Apple frames its device as a computer. Meta says it’s lined up 500 games and apps for the headset, including a Ghostbusters title",error,513
257," in its iPhone sales,” wrote Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar. Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India. Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins, analysts say. Apple’s profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. Wall Street likes to see Apple’s services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services reaccelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales. Apple suggested a 5% year-over-year increase in services, and FactSet’s estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that. “For the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho wrote. Analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industrywide obsession with the technology and a recent Bloomberg report that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don’t expect Apple to gush about what it’s working on internally, though. “With the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple’s updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers. Apple reports its results by product line, which can give investors a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%, according to FactSet estimates. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch — and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale — is projected to decline less than 1%. However, analysts expect Apple’s services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis",error,513
261," because it makes the phone lighter. It feels better in the hand. Apple’s Pro phones have been getting heavier since 2019, but this phone reverses the trend. Apple says that the 6-inch iPhone 15 Pro is 187 grams, or 9% lighter than last year’s model. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, with a bigger 6.7-inch screen, weighs 8% less. But in practice, it feels like an even bigger reduction. Going back to my old iPhone 14 Pro, it feels like a brick. The weight difference between this year’s Pros and last year’s is noticeable even with a case. Not only are this year’s Pro phones lighter, but they are also slightly narrower and shorter in length, although they’re marginally thicker than last year’s devices. They have a smaller border (bezel) around the same-sized screen, and it’s noticeable when holding the two devices side-by-side. But this also means last year’s cases won’t work with this year’s phones. The weight difference is subtle but will be meaningful to many people, making daily use more delightful — and marathon TikTok and YouTube sessions less tiring.  I used the iPhone 15 Pro without a case, and it didn’t feel particularly fragile. But phones drop and break, and the new frame comes with one additional benefit: Significantly cheaper repairs. If the back glass on the iPhone 15 shatters, Apple is charging either $169 or $199 for a replacement, depending on screen size. On the iPhone 14 Pros, that price was either $499 or $549. Apple says it’s because this model is much easier to repair. Zoom lens Apple has also improved the zoom camera on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. While the smaller phone still has a 3x zoom, the bigger phone now comes with a 5x zoom lens that mimics some of the better physical zoom lenses on standalone cameras that can be as long as 10 inches. Basically, the new iPhone allows you to get closer to your subject without physically getting closer. It also comes with a nifty new kind of three-dimensional image stabilization that prevents the zoom shots from getting blurry, which is a problem with actual big zoom lenses. The handheld zoom shots on the iPhone 15 Pro Max were pretty sharp and clear.  The new lens will be very useful for day-to-day usage, as it makes more of the world around you easier",error,513
261," to photograph. Parents will use it for kids’ sports, outdoors enthusiasts will use it take photos of birds and wildlife, and tourists will use it to get better vacation shots. It’s also a reason to reach for the bigger iPhone 15 Pro Max over the cheaper but lighter and smaller iPhone 15 Pro. USB-C Apple’s iPhones have a new charger for the first time in a decade. Meet the USB-C port. Apple’s change was prompted by European regulation, and will make being an iPhone owner a little more convenient, because you’ll be able to share your iPhone cord with laptops, headphones, iPads, and other newer gadgets. You can use a laptop charger to charge the iPhone, or use your iPhone’s charger to fill up your headphones. The port change on the iPhone Pros also opens up some cool new abilities. For example, if you have a USB-C monitor dock, like many corporate workers do, you can now likely plug your phone into a monitor, which mirrors what’s on your phone screen, for presentations, or perhaps to watch a movie or play a game. That was possible before, with a dongle, but now anyone with a new iPhone and recent monitor dock can do it. You can also now use a powered-up iPhone to charge other gadgets, such as AirPods or Apple Watch, or even another iPhone, using a cord coming from its USB-C port. They don’t charge fast, but it works. USB-C is a great improvement, although it won’t be immediately smooth for a lot of people. For example, the cord in my car for Apple CarPlay is currently using Lightning, the old connector, and not everyone in my family is upgrading to the new phones. I’ll have to use a dongle for a while. Action button The other big physical change to the iPhones this year is the Action button, which replaces the mute-switch. The button is surprisingly nice, and I can see a lot of people using it every single day. Most people leave their phones on mute all the time, and there are several ways to mute or unmute your phone through software settings. The new button provides haptic feedback when it’s pressed, and Apple has provided several convenient ways to use it. My personal favorite is as a camera button. Press it quickly, and it brings up the camera. Press it again, and it takes a photo. If you hold",error,513
261," it down, it takes a video. Another interesting application is to quickly bring up a translation app that can take your spoken words and turn it into one of several foreign languages, and it translates responses as well. The button is also customizable through Apple’s iPhone macro program called Shortcuts, which means people will come up with a number of creative uses once it’s released to the public. New portrait features Other camera improvements include the ability to change focus in many photos after they’re taken. It’s part of the ability to use “Portrait Mode” without specifically taking a Portrait Mode photo. Any photo taken with the iPhone 15 Pro’s camera that either has a manual focus (tapping the screen) or has a human or pet in the frame will automatically capture the depth information needed to tweak the photo after-the-fact. Photos with Apple’s depth data can do lots of stuff, like changing the focus in the image, or Portrait Mode, which can vignette the background or give a softer focus to the subject. Photos with Apple’s depth mdata are marked in the camera roll with a stylized “f” symbol. Apple’s main camera on the Pros also takes 24 megapixel photos, combining a larger 48-megapixel image with a smaller 12-megapixel image to synthesize a new photo with better range of light and additional details. It’s a subtle improvement but comforting if you shoot a lot of photos and just want them all to be good. A17 chip The iPhone Pros get the A17 Pro chip, the latest and greatest Apple silicon, as compared to the mainstream iPhone 15s, which have last year’s Pro model A16 Bionic chip. In day-to-day use, you won’t notice the difference, because the iPhone is generally snappy. But Apple says the chip has a new 6-core GPU design that can handle “ray tracing,” an advanced kind of graphics computation previously limited to high-end gaming cards that essentially simulates light. It’s also got a better “neural engine” for running artificial intelligence. There aren’t ray-tracing enabled games available yet on Apple’s App Store, but there are console-level titles such as the forthcoming Resident Evil Village that will take advantage of the new chip. For most people, having the latest chip means there’s another year",error,513
261," at the end of the phone’s life when it’s likely to get updates. Standby mode One of the phone’s niftiest new features allows it to turn into a dashboard that displays real-time information, such as calendar appointments, photos, and even things like how close your pizza is to being delivered. This feature works with older phones, too, that have updated to the latest version of iOS, and requires a MagSafe charging stand. It’s going to be great for office workers. Heat I only encountered a hot iPhone 15 Pro Max once, when playing the Apple Arcade title “Zookeeper World.” However, for about 5 minutes, the phone was too hot to hold, especially on the titanium frame, and I had to put it down. Heat issues haven’t cropped up since in my testing. iPhone setup Apple’s automatic iPhone transfer system has come a long way. When I got my review unit, all I had to do is sign in with my Apple ID, and hold my old phone next to the new one, and my texts, apps, photos and files all transferred. I’m an iCloud subscriber, but it was still pretty seamless. But the process still isn’t perfect, and users should know it may take a day to make sure everything is transferred over. For example, my Apple Watch didn’t immediately transfer to pairing with the new phone — and I had to be careful, because I had a farecard on my Watch with a significant amount of money on it, and if I wasn’t careful about how I transferred it, I might have lost it. A few health settings didn’t immediately sync either, and required my attention to sort out. The iPhone 15 Pros are one of the best upgrades in many years for Apple’s high-end phones, although the core of what an iPhone does hasn’t changed at all. Any of Apple’s phones currently on sale — which include 2022 and 2021 models at discounts — can make calls, send texts, download apps, and take great photographs. If you’re upgrading after a few years, all of Apple’s phones are big improvements, and they’ll all get the job done. But there are also people who know they use their phone for hours per day. In fact, Apple’s Screen Time feature often reminds them of just how much time each week they spend on their iPhone",error,513
265,"CDMS] business: contract, design and manufacturing services,” said Jun Seki, Hon Hai’s chief strategy officer for EVs, told CNBC in a separate interview. “Our strategy is we attack all. Component module platform makes our cost very competitive. This is an area that makes traditional auto OEMs profitability very poor, he said referring to original equipment manufacturer, which are products sold to other companies as components. “Sometimes we may have to build their cars by their drawings. If our customers can give a chance to us, we can build our ideas into their cars, then we can make customers more competitive,” said Jun. However, the global EV market is only getting more competitive. China, Europe and the U.S. are major players when it comes to electric cars. From third-quarter 2021 to second-quarter this year, the top three players – Tesla, BYD and Volkswagen – held 42% of the global EV market, according to Counterpoint Research. Foxconn’s foray into semiconductor has had a tough start, pointing to the difficulty for new players to enter a market dominated by firms with extensive experience and a highly intricate supply chain. Earlier this year, Foxconn pulled out of a joint venture with Indian metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta to set up a semiconductor and display production plant in India as part of a $19.5 billion deal. “You call it a failure, but I don’t think it’s finalized yet. I think we learnt through the way how we interpret, how we work with the government. So far, the government is still not making a decision yet. So I will not call it a failure at this moment. We are all still trying to work with the government, to find ways so the government will support our proposal,” Young Liu, Hon Hai’s CEO and chairman, told CNBC. In August, the government of the state of Karnataka in India said Foxconn will pump in more than $600 million to build a phone manufacturing project and a separate semiconductor equipment facility. India could account for 20% to 30% of Hon Hai’s manufacturing, which is “very similar to China,” Liu said. This comes as Foxconn started diversifying production away from China amid persistent tensions between Beijing and Washington. “We’ve been working with countries like India, Indonesia and Thailand. They’re all going quite well,” the CEO",error,513

Meanwhile, Apple still makes the bulk of its money from iPhones, which generated $51.3 billion of its $94.84 billion in revenue during the company’s fiscal second quarter. Why talk a big AI game? Besides, mega-cap tech companies signaled to investors earlier this week in earnings calls that the rollout of AI products could take a while. In Microsoft’s case, Nadella tempered investor expectations for Copilot, signaling that growth would take time, and finance chief Amy Hood said that its rollout would be “gradual.” It could take until next year before investors understand how the Copilot subscription affects the company’s revenue. “In the second half of the next fiscal year, we’ll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it,” Nadella said. Google and Pichai say that the company’s text-generating AI models will make its search engine better and could even answer questions that normal Google search can’t. From a business perspective, Pichai said, generative AI used for creating and serving ads will “supercharge” the company’s existing ads business, adding there are “opportunities” for new kinds of ads with AI-generated search. But Pichai said it’s still “early days” for the new AI-powered search, and later, when pressed about how SGE might increase usage of the search engine, and therefore increase revenue, he said the company was experimenting. “I think we are definitely headed in the right direction, and we can see it in our metrics and the feedback we’re getting from our users as well,” Pichai said. Zuckerberg was effusive about AI technology and its applications in virtual reality, ad targeting and recommending content from accounts users don’t follow. He was particularly optimistic about a concept called “AI agents,” in which software would be able to message business customers automatically without a human involved, or act as a coach, or be a personal assistant. Still, Zuckerberg admitted he didn’t know how many people would use the new AI features. “The reality is, we just don’t know how quickly these will scale,” Zuckerberg said. He said Meta was debating internally how much it should",error,513
293," spend on servers for AI. The slow rollout of revenue-generating AI products from Big Tech matters because many people in the industry believe that new foundational technologies go through a “hype cycle” based on research from analysis firm Gartner. When new technology is introduced, according to the hype cycle model, it gains lots of attention and investment as it reaches a “peak of inflated expectations.” But, as the deployment of the tech moves slower than initially expected, enthusiasm and investment dry up, in a “trough of disillusionment,” before maturing and becoming productive. For now, “shovel makers” and people seeking investment capital are benefiting from the AI boom. Nvidia stock has risen 220% so far in 2023 as investors have realized its graphics processing units are essential for the technology. Venture capital investment in AI startups has boomed, and many of those dollars are going to Nvidia for computer capacity, and to cloud providers for access to AI models. But if everyday consumer applications for AI don’t catch on, then many AI companies could slip into the trough of disillusionment again. Analysts found earlier this month, for example, that downloads for OpenAI’s iPhone app slowed earlier this month after launching in May. Some analysts are starting to understand that an investment opportunity based on new AI products won’t be immediate and that the costs could stack up. “We cautioned investors that that process of translating early demand to large-scale implementations and recognized revenue will be a multi-year trend rather than an instantaneous flip of a switch,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy wrote this week. “We recommend investors invest elsewhere until Metaverse, Reels, Threads, Quest and Generative AI investments become accretive (if ever) to META’s [return on invested capital], rather than dilutive,” Needham’s Laura Martin wrote in a note. UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote this week that generative AI was still an “overhang” over Google. “Management expressed optimism around the ability to solve for ‘deeper and broader’ use cases with Search Generative Experience (SGE), but we do not believe the company is out of the woods with management still describing monetization as having a ‘number of experiments in flight including (for) ads,’” Walmsley wrote.

Don’t have to say “Hey” to Siri anymore. Apple has made the command to awaken its voice assistant shorter. Photos recognizes pets as their own person. Apple’s machine learning has been able to detect cats or dogs in photos for a few years, but now it can identify individual pets and put them in their own photos folders.

321," to next-generation mobile internet that promises super-fast speeds. Huawei has not confirmed the phone is 5G capable, but reviews have shown the device is capable of hitting download speeds associated with 5G. The semiconductor has been manufactured using a 7 nanometer process by SMIC, according to an analysis of the Mate 60 Pro by software company TechInsights. The nanometer figure refers to the size of each individual transistor on a chip. The smaller the transistor, the more of them can be packed onto a single semiconductor. Typically, a reduction in nanometer size can yield more powerful and efficient chips. The 7 nm process is seen as highly advanced in the world of semiconductors, even though it is not the latest technology. For years, SMIC struggled to make 7 nm chips. That’s in part because it couldn’t get its hands on a very expensive and crucial device called an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine. These are made by Dutch firm ASML, but the company has been restricted by its government from sending these machines to China. Many thought this would hold back SMIC’s ability to make advanced chips. But it seems to have made it happen without these tools. In a blogpost this month, Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, said the 7 nm chip “demonstrates the technical progress China’s semiconductor industry has been able to make without EUV lithography tools.” Huawei was not immediately available for comment regarding this story when contacted by CNBC. From a technology perspective, it is significant that SMIC has manufactured chips using a 7 nm process without ASML’s EUV machines. Pranay Kotasthane, deputy director of the Takshashila Institution, told CNBC that it is likely that equipment used for older manufacturing processes are being “repurposed” for these more advanced chips. But he believes the process is likely being undertaken with “lower efficiency” than if SMIC were to use cutting-edge equipment. And that’s a key point. While SMIC is able to create 7 nm chips, it’s unclear how efficient, profitable and sustainable that is on a bigger scale. A closely watched metric is “yield” — the number of chips made out of a specific wafer. If a chip manufacturer’s yield is low, then the process is not seen as efficient and can be costly. While the yield of SM",error,513
321,"IC’s 7 nm process for Huawei chips is not known, it is “probably low,” Kotasthane said. It is a waiting game to see if SMIC can produce the number of chips that Huawei requires at a profitable scale. The technology advancement has certainly rattled Washington. The U.S. Department of Commerce issued a statement this month saying it is looking to get more information on Huawei’s chip. SMIC’s 7 nm manufacturing process has also exposed some of the weaknesses in the U.S.′ export restriction strategy, which could lead to further curbs. “There will be pressure on the U.S. to reconsider its export controls strategy, which was based on the assumption that controls would prevent Chinese companies from producing advanced-edge chips, while the business-as-usual approach would continue at the trailing-edge nodes. It is increasingly becoming clear that this distinction doesn’t work in reality,” Kotasthane said. He added that Washington may look at other areas of the chip design and manufacturing process to enact further restrictions. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Chinese central government staffers had been banned from using iPhones and other foreign-branded phones for work and even prohibited them from being brought into the office. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last week there weren’t any regulations prohibiting the purchase and use of foreign phones. As geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to bubble under the surface, it is perhaps a potential Huawei resurgence that poses the biggest threat to Apple. “It’s expected that Huawei will pose a bigger challenge to Apple in China than the geopolitical issue,” Will Wong, a senior research manager at IDC, told CNBC. “This is because Huawei not only has the same premium brand image as Apple but also is a national pride in China.” Apple is seen as a high-end smartphone maker and Huawei had directly competed with the U.S. firm in China for years. But Huawei’s sales fell off a cliff when it couldn’t equip its smartphones with 5G technology and the latest chips. Any kind of resurgence in this area, as appears to be the case with the Mate 60 Pro, could make Huawei’s new phones an attractive option again for Chinese buyers. “The biggest threat from Huawei is its continuous development in technology, not only in chips but also in new form factors like foldables,",error,513
326,"’s wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores. Apple’s India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said. Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India “has the potential to reach that scale” in the coming years. Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country. Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years. “Apple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,” Ives said in a note published Tuesday. But it’s not just about selling iPhones. Apple’s strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music. “Apple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,” Shah said. For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future. Apple began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India last year — the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India’s minister of commerce and industry, said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India. Part of the move in India is tied to the government’s push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world’s second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak. Production was disrupted last year at Apple’s biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou",error,513
327," that Apple reported nearly $6 billion in sales in the year ending in March. Cook has also made the India-China comparison to investors. “We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear,” Cook said on an earnings call earlier this year. India is the largest market that the iPhone hasn’t fully cracked, meaning it is critical for sales growth. Cook boasted in February that the company was successfully wooing “switchers” in the country. That’s Apple’s word for previous Android phone owners who have decided to buy their first iPhone. Cook said in February that Apple had its best sales quarter ever for iPhones in India in the quarter ending in December. Indians who buy iPhones are much more likely to be “switchers” than customers elsewhere because Android dominates the Indian market, led by Samsung and several Chinese brands. Android had over 95% of market share in the country, according to Statcounter. The main reason is price. Most phones sold in India are priced below even the least-expensive new Apple iPhone. Industry analyst IDC estimated in February that the average selling price of a smartphone in India is $224, which had increased 18% in 2022. Apple’s entry level phone — the iPhone SE — retails for $429 in the U.S. One way for Apple to address this gap is by allowing customers to pay for their phones in installments, or giving them a discount for trading in an older device. Cook mentioned these strategies when he was asked about India in February. “There’s been a lot done from financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy,” Cook said. The two physical Apple stores opening this week and the online Apple store which launched in the country in 2020 are also expected to boost sales. The second part of the strategy is to build Apple products in the country, a massive project that requires not only Apple’s attention, but also efforts from its manufacturing partners and local and national governments. Nearly all iPhones are currently assembled in China, which has caused some problems over the past five years, starting with trade tensions and possible tariffs during the Trump administration, and extending to more recent supply chain disruptions caused by Covid and China’s Covid policies, which led to sales shortfalls. India could end up being a big winner as Apple looks for non-Chinese manufacturing options",error,513
327,". In January, India’s commerce minister told CNBC that Apple was manufacturing its latest iPhone 14 in the country and had a goal to produce as many as 25% of all iPhones in the country. Apple’s primary manufacturing partner, Foxconn, which oversees a large portion of the assembly of new iPhones in China, is expanding in India, too, reportedly building a $700 million plant for iPhone parts in Bangalore. In another parallel to China, the Indian government is eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development. Over the past 20 years, Chinese governments at multiple levels have worked to make massive factories like Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory — known as “iPhone City” — possible. Modi wants to discuss Apple’s plans for manufacturing around the country and creating manufacturing jobs, CNBC’s Seema Mody reported. He also wants to know about the challenges Apple has faced in growing its user base in the country. This isn’t the first time that investors have been excited about Apple’s potential in India, and some analysts warn that it may take a while before it becomes a huge market. “I’ve told investors this: All the all the hype you’re hearing about India this week is great,” Zino said. “I mean, it is a massive opportunity in our view, over the next decade, but don’t expect things to change overnight.” Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengalaru assembling older model iPhones, which erupted in a labor riot in late 2020. Apple has had its eyes on an India expansion since at least 2016, when Cook previously met Modi. At that meeting, Cook told Modi about the potential for manufacturing and retailing Apple goods in the country. Now, six years later, Cook is back in India to open up the company’s first two owned-and-operated retail stores. Apple was bullish on India back then, too: “India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022,” Cook told CNBC’s Jim Cramer at the time, saying it had “huge market potential.” Apple’s long-term strategy in India is best summarized by a quote Cook gave to local media during his 2016 trip to the subcontinent. “We are putting enormous energy in",error,513
328," Germany for global iPhone shipments in 2022. “The population growth and pure opportunity around India is the golden goose for Apple. It’s been a difficult market to ramp for Apple on the iPhone front over the years but now is clearly starting to find its stride,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.  The technology giant currently manufactures 5% to 7% of its iPhones in India, a leap from just 1% in 2021 — and there’s no stopping there with further plans in the works to increase the company’s prominence in the country.  “China and the US along with Europe remain the hearts and lungs of the Apple story with India set to become a top 5 market focus for Apple. High hopes India can be a major incremental growth driver for Cupertino in the years ahead,” Ives told CNBC via email.  Although the Indian government said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India, Ives said that’s a “lofty” goal and hitting 10% to 15% of production seems more realistic in the long term.  India will also continue to play second fiddle to Vietnam in the production of more sophisticated products such as the MacBooks, but smaller products such as Apple’s smart watches and AirPods being manufactured in India soon, Singh said. There is such a concentration of the market in the urban centers, and Delhi and Mumbai “make up almost a quarter of the market for Apple [in India],” IDC’s Singh said, adding that more physical stores could open by the middle of 2024.  IDC data showed Apple only has a 5% market share in India since low-to-mid-tier priced devices continue to be consumers’ top choices. However, the country’s increasing adoption in technology and stronger spending power from consumers will generate higher iPhone sales, Fitch’s Soni said.  “We see that the middle class is becoming more affluent and moving towards the upper middle class, and there is an increasing trend of customers buying flagship smartphones,” Soni said. “This is also helped by the fact that 4G is now easily available all over India.”  But cheaper labor costs in India will not reduce the costs of Apple’s iPhones as customers would be willing to pay premium prices for Apple products, Singh said.  Apple will not reach the “price",error,513
331," developers and bring the technology closer to its ultimate promise: a headset you wear daily, as you go about your business, or perhaps a pair of lightweight glasses, helping you with contextual information. “It’s good to see others get into this business, particularly Apple, who doesn’t jump into markets too early,” Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson told CNBC. “That is a huge validation of what we have been doing to date, and we welcome that, because it’s also good for the ecosystem.” Here’s why Apple could succeed where everybody else has failed. Apple seldom invents something unprecedented. Instead, it takes existing ideas and refines them in critical ways that make them a lot more appealing to consumers. Before the iPod, there were several hardware MP3 players in the market. Before the iPhone was released, the Blackberry had merged a wireless cellular internet connection and pocket computer into what is still called a smartphone, and other companies were building smartphones based on Microsoft’s Windows Mobile system. When Apple released the Apple Watch, there were many other smartwatches on the market, chasing a concept that had been around in cartoons and science fiction for decades. Historically, Apple uses its significant consumer brand and hefty marketing budget to explain to consumers why they need its latest gadget. “Apple has a trust and a granted entitlement that no one else has, and they’ve earned it,” said Jarrett Webb, a technology director at Argodesign who develops mixed-reality apps. “They have this leadership position and this poise to help define, and give confidence, to this new form of computing.” The best example of this was at the original iPhone launch. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple and CEO at the time, described the new device as a combination of three things: an internet communications device, an MP3 player and a phone. The language may be dated now. The clunky phrase “internet communications device” transformed into “there’s an app for that” quickly. But it still showed how Apple can quickly slim down a pitch for a new gadget into terms consumers understand. For now, the world of headset technology is confusing and has no clear use cases. Industry practitioners spend a lot of time explaining the differences between augmented, virtual and mixed reality. If Apple can demystify the whole industry for the public, it could end up with the first headset mainstream consumers understand and want. Plus, Apple has",error,513
331," about 34 million developers for its current phones. That’s a huge resource Apple could encourage to build the killer app that would turn its headset into a must-have. When Apple releases a headset, it won’t just have the technology Apple developed in secret. It will have a base of software and hardware infrastructure Apple has been building and buying for years. Starting in 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook began frequently talking about the benefits of augmented reality, often contrasting it with the limitations of virtual reality. Around the same time, Apple started buying several companies focused on specific technologies that could end up in a headset. — In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, whose 3D camera sensor eventually ended up being part of the basis for Face ID, the company’s facial recognition system for iPhones, and influenced the company’s current depth-sensing cameras.— In 2015, Apple bought Metaio, which made AR software for mobile devices.— In 2016, it bought Flyby Media, which worked on computer vision technology.— In 2017, it bought SensoMotoric Instruments, which developed eye tracking, a core VR technology, as well as Vrvrana, which developed a VR headset.— In 2018, it bought Akonia Holographics, which developed transparent lenses for AR glasses— It bought NextVR, which filmed video content for virtual reality, including sports. Apple also started releasing developer’s kits for augmented reality, including one called ARKit, which could use the iPhone’s hardware to create limited AR experiences on the phone, such as interacting with a virtual pet or trying out digital furniture in a living room. Apple now has an entire library of software to perform difficult tasks the headset will need to be able to do to integrate the real world and a virtual world seamlessly. — RealityKit allows developers to render graphics that mesh with the real world.— RoomPlan scans the room around the user.— Animoji is a 3D avatar that can match the user’s facial expression.— Spatial Audio can make audio sound like it’s coming from somewhere, not just from the user’s headphones. When the Apple Watch hit the market, Apple didn’t know entirely what it was going to be. Cook even said at its release the company was excited to learn what developers would do with it. One early thought is the Apple Watch was going to be a fashion must-have. In the early days of the product, Apple spent a lot of time courting fashion media and seeding the",error,513
334," integrated with 5G technology, and are streaming content from a Cloud Edge network,” Wang told CNBC. “HTC VIVE has already invented this technology, and we will lead this paradigm shift in the near future.” HTC has pivoted over the years from an expertise in smartphones to increased focus on VR, as it struggled to win traction in the highly competitive handsets market. In 2018, the Taiwanese firm sold most of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion. The VR industry has long struggled to be taken seriously, with consumers mainly looking to it as a way of playing casual games rather than a device embedded in their everyday lives. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has staked its whole future on the idea that people will engage in virtual worlds through VR products like its Meta Quest line of headsets and Horizon Worlds VR social game, in a network of vast virtual worlds known as the “metaverse.” But Meta hasn’t yet found broad commercial appeal for its product — it is losing billions of dollars on its investment into the technology each year. Sales of VR headsets have underperformed lately, particularly as consumers are grappling with a sharp rise in the cost of living. Research group NPD Group told CNBC last December that sales of VR headsets in the U.S. declined 2% in 2022 from a year earlier, to $1.1 billion. It’s more of a surprising launch for a company like Apple, which has typically stuck to waiting for a product to get mass adoption before it enters a product category. Nevertheless, industry executives said the launch marked a significant milestone for the nascent mixed reality market. It signifies how mixed reality is likely to have more viable use cases in the business-facing side of things, said Urho Konttori, chief technology officer of Finnish mixed reality startup Varjo, in an emailed comment. “Apple’s entrance into XR with Vision Pro is an important moment for our whole industry,” Konttori said. “Mixed reality is already a fixture in the enterprise sector, and the innovative technologies pioneered by Varjo have changed the way the world’s biggest companies work, train, design, conduct research, and collaborate.” “We hope today is the turning point for consumers when it starts being part of their everyday lives too, with promising applications for entertainment, personal productivity, and communication,” he added. Leo Gebbie",error,513
335,",” he said. But, Patel said even after using the Vision Pro, he did not have a clear answer for what the headsets will ultimately be used for. TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino said the Vision Pro is “nothing less than a genuine leapfrog in capability and execution” of mixed reality. He said that the gesture control and eye tracking on the device is “near perfect,” and he found that the resolution made text easy to read. Movies were also a highlight for Panzarino: “3D Movies are actually good in it,” he wrote. He said that the headset is “really, really well done,” but that he isn’t sure whether the headset will really bring about the onset of spatial computing like Apple claims. Stratechery’s Ben Thompson said he found the Vision Pro experience “extraordinary,” and that it surpassed his high expectations. He said the user interface feels natural, and that it is “surprising” how high resolution it is. He said critics are right to question what the device will be used for. Thompson suspects a lot of early Vision Pro users will likely buy the device because they are “Apple super fans” or because they are “interested in its novelty value.” Thompson wondered if the Vision Pro might become the world’s “most expensive paper weight.” Even so, he said he suspects the Vision Pro is “the future of the Mac.”′ Wired’s Lauren Goode said the Vision Pro’s best selling point is its ability to adjust the immersion level of the virtual environment. She said the headset also “shone” in the entertainment category because of the dynamic experience, and she found that it was intuitive to use. Goode said the headset felt “hefty,” even with the external battery pack, and her face “breathed with relief” when she took it off. She added that, unlike other Apple devices, this one can’t disappear into a pocket or a bag, so it requires some “suspension of disbelief and a sacrifice of autonomy” to use it. “Even Apple can’t out-design its way out of what is fundamentally an obtrusive technology,” Goode wrote. The Financial Times’ Patrick McGee said the Vision Pro has an “intuitive interface that is novel and",error,513
351," off more than 31% to just over $7.17 billion. But that’s a difficult comparison from the year-earlier period when Apple was still benefiting from the end of a pandemic boom in PC sales and a shift to its own chips that offer longer laptop battery life.   “There’s really two reasons for that,” Cook said. “One is the macro situation in general. And the other is where we’re still comparing to the very difficult compare of the M1 MacBook Pro 14 and 16-inch from the year-ago quarter.”  Revenue from iPads declined nearly 13% to $6.67 billion.   Apple’s Services business includes monthly subscriptions, revenue from Apple’s App Store, warranties and search-licensing revenue from companies like Google. Apple reported $20.9 billion in services revenue, a 5.5% year-over-year increase, signaling the company’s highest-margin business line continues to grow.   Apple’s wearables division, including Apple Watch and headphones such as AirPods, dropped 1% during the quarter, beating analyst expectations. Last fall, the company released a more expensive Apple Watch, called Ultra.   Apple’s China regional business, which includes the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, reported $17.81 billion in sales, down from last year’s $18.34 billion. Analysts had hoped that China’s demand for electronics would rise in the quarter as the company exits out of Covid-era lockdowns and other restrictions.   While sales shrunk in most regions that Apple monitors, they grew in the Asia Pacific region to $8.11 billion. Cook was optimistic about Apple’s prospects in India after his visit last month to the country where he opened Apple stores and met with politicians.   “The switcher and first-time buyer metrics look very good there for India,” Cook said. Apple uses the term “switcher” to refer to first-time iPhone buyers who previously had Android devices.   As expected, Apple’s board authorized $90 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Apple said it paid $23 billion in buybacks and dividends in the March quarter. Apple also raised its dividend 4% to 24 cents per share.   Cook also said that Apple was not planning layoffs like those that other big tech companies have started over the past year.  �",error,513
358," sending the stock down by almost two-thirds, partly on concerns about the excessive metaverse costs. But the shares have rebounded this year after Zuckerberg reeled in expenses in other corners of the company, including customer service, and trust and safety. For Zuckerberg, turning mixed reality into a business reality has become central to the company’s future. Unlike Apple or Google parent Alphabet, Meta doesn’t control an operating system akin to iOS or Android. Those platforms have allowed Apple and Google to dominate the smartphone market, helping them generate billions of dollars from their respective app stores and allowing them to dictate the rules that third-party developers — including Facebook — must follow. Apple’s 2021 privacy change to iOS so badly wounded Facebook that the company predicted soon thereafter that it would result in a $10 billion hit to revenue in 2022. The update limited the ability for Facebook and other social media companies to track users across the web and deliver targeted advertising. Meta’s massive and fast-growing online ad business suddenly found its business shrinking. Zuckerberg has been vocal about what he considers to be Apple’s unfair iOS and app store policies. His company said that by removing targeting capabilities, Apple was badly hurting the many small businesses that used Facebook’s ad model to reach new customers in an efficient way. Last November, Zuckerberg said at a conference that “Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control unilaterally what apps get on a device.” He added, “I don’t think that’s a sustainable or good place to be.” For his part, Cook has been unsympathetic, long criticizing Facebook for being in the business of making money off users’ personal information rather than selling a product that people want to buy. In 2021, Cook linked Facebook’s business model to real-world consequences like violence or reducing public trust in Covid. “If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform,” Cook said at a data privacy conference in Brussels. He didn’t mention Facebook by name at the time. By developing the metaverse on its own terms, Meta has its best shot at sidestepping Apple’s dominance and writing its own rules. It’s a giant gamble, though, envisioning that the metaverse will tip into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Apple knows all",error,513
362,": photos, iMessages, Apple TV, Safari and so on, floating in front of me. To select an app (or anything else you want to “click”), you look at what you want and then make a pinching gesture with your thumb and index finger to select it. Cameras on the inside of Apple Vision track your eyes and recognize what you’re looking at. The external cameras track your hand movements. Meta’s headset has a similar feature, but it doesn’t work nearly as well as it does on Apple Vision, if it works at all. (Meta ships its headset with a wireless controller for better control.) Opening an app in turn brings a window floating before you, and you can surround yourself with apps if you’d like, almost like working on multiple screens on a desktop computer. The apps look just as crisp as an app on an iPhone or MacBook. That’s significant — until now, I’ve never used a headset with visuals that clear. I went through several demos like browsing through a library of images in photos, including panoramic ones that made it feel like I was inside the scene. Apple TV is another key app — you can place a virtual movie screen anywhere in the room. I watched a 3-D clip of the latest “Avatar” movie, and it was just as clear as watching on my 4K TV at home. You can also rotate the Digital Crown clockwise to bring the headset into full virtual reality and place yourself in an immersive environment, like a starry night in the wilderness. I especially liked that for watching a movie — it felt like I was sitting in my own personalized IMAX theater. But VR doesn’t take you fully out of the real world. If someone is in the room with you and you look at them for a few seconds, the headset slowly fades them into view within your immersive environment. The other demo worth mentioning: FaceTime. An Apple employee wearing her own Vision Pro in a separate room gave me a call and she popped up in a window hovering in front of me. But it wasn’t her actual face — it was a realistic-looking avatar Apple calls a “persona.” Apple’s demo didn’t let me scan my face with Vision Pro to make my own persona, but the one belonging to the woman I was talking to looked enough like her that it tricked me into thinking it was a regular video chat",error,513
363,"’s goggles has also enabled a relatively new concept, sometimes called “XR,” “mixed reality” or “passthrough,” or, as Apple dubs it, “spatial computing.” The cameras on the outside of the Vision Pro can display the real world in near-real time inside the headset, which makes the technology less isolating, and addresses one long-time issue with virtual reality: Users can’t see what’s around them while they’re in virtual reality. But Apple also has to change the public perception of virtual reality. The moment that everyday consumers wear headsets daily may still be years away. One notable aspect of Apple’s Vision Pro is it has a lot of raw power and expensive parts. Past initial Apple products didn’t emphasize processor speed, display resolution or specifications — the Vision Pro does. A short and incomplete list of its components we know so far: All these specs put together means the Vision Pro operates at a higher level of fidelity than products currently on the market, such as Meta’s $299 Quest 2, which uses a mobile processor and has lower resolution screens. The Vision Pro also costs a whole lot more: It costs at least $3,499, and likely even more if users opt for custom lenses or other potential upgrades, such as storage. The powerful specs allow the Vision Pro to display the outside world through video feeds on the inside of the headset in real time, making it the first device to do both high-quality VR, which transports users to a virtual world, and augmented reality, which integrates virtual objects into the real world. “Apple seems to be all in on the notion that it will let you see out, but it will let you see out using cameras and passthrough and very, very, very, low latency and very, very, very, high-powered computing and processing applied to the problem,” said Avi Greengart, analyst at Techsponential, who demoed the headset earlier this week at Apple’s campus. That’s compared to rival devices such as Magic Leap and Microsoft Hololens, which use transparent displays that require less processing power but offer lower-quality images. This level of visual quality means demos can be better and developers don’t have to limit themselves based on the hardware. There’s headroom for new experiences that require a lot of processing power. It also establishes a floor",error,513
363," for virtual reality experiences going forward: Once people have tried an Apple headset, with thousands of dollars of computing gear, it will be more difficult to use a cheaper headset without seeing the trade-offs. “Apple is unapologetically saying, in order to do VR, or AR, or what they’re calling ‘spatial computing,’ this is the experience you need to offer, and that’s the price point it’s going to cost,” said Greengart. “Anyone else coming out with a product at that price point would simply be dismissed as niche. But Apple, because of its history with consumer products, and because of its history iterating, you can expect the experience gets better over time, and the price comes down — well, hopefully it comes down.” Just as the iPhone did, the Vision Pro introduces a new kind of user interface. The iPhone introduced multitouch screens, replacing styluses and mechanical keyboards, and enabled web browsing and full-color maps on a pocket device. “The user experience is always the most important aspect. The most important part of the iPhone wasn’t shrinking it down, the display quality the multitouch, but it was making that UX feel good and magical,” Chennavasin said. The Vision Pro replaces controllers with simple gestures. The user’s eyes become the cursor and a simple tap of the thumb and index finger selects a button. “No other headset has really introduced eye-plus-pinch as the main interaction modality,” said Jamin Hu, technical chief of Doublepoint, a private firm working on software to enable gesture-based interactions. “Apple is the first one that we’ve seen focusing on building their entire operating system to support eye tracking.” Eye tracking often uses small sensors to see where the user’s gaze is resting. It works well, according to people who had controlled hands-on demos earlier this week. “Meta’s headset has a similar feature, but it doesn’t work nearly as well as it does on Apple Vision, if it works at all,” wrote CNBC’s Steve Kovach. The controller-less, gesture-based interface has been a goal of the VR industry for years. “I think it’s pretty well-known in the industry that eye-plus-pinch is magical. It’s even faster than the computer mouse. And it",error,513
363,"’s easier to learn,” said Hu. Apple even brought up its record on new computer interfaces as one reason to believe in the potential of Vision Pro. “So, in the same way that Mac introduced us to personal computing and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the launch. The VR industry has waited years for Apple’s formal entry. Developers and experts believed Apple could set the standard once it launched its own headset. It invented the iPhone, and it could be inventing the next major mainstream computing product now. “You have this element that Apple never comes into an industry until they really know this is going to be something special,” said Sean Mann, CEO of RP1, a technology firm working to enable immersive online experiences. Apple is likely to have the strongest pipeline of apps that could take advantage of the unique aspects of a VR headset. It already has millions of software developers, and the Vision Pro will support iPhone and iPad apps at launch. No other headset has that. “Apple has the unique ability to catalyze developer interest in new platforms,” Greengart said. “For the Apple Vision Pro, the App Store is going to be there on day one.” Plus, Apple has a product ecosystem it can integrate with, from iPhones, Apple Watches and even the Mac. The headset can even function as a massive Mac monitor for getting work done. Apple also has retail stores that are well-suited to be a first experience in virtual reality for people who are curious about the technology. Apple’s headset needs significant configuration, including head scans and custom lenses for people who wear glasses. But if any company was well-suited to provide those demos to give them the best chance to elicit a “wow,” it’s Apple. “No one else in the industry has what Apple has. Apple has the phone, they have the watch, they have the desktop and now they have a headset, and they all work with each other,” Mann said. “Something that I capture on my cell phone now could easily be shown in my new Vision Pro, and that ecosystem doesn’t exist in any other VR manufacturer.” The industry is still nascent. Data from Forrester, a research firm, found 79% of online adults don’t currently use a VR headset. “It can be read as",error,513
374," Canalys said it expects Vision Pro and related devices would have a user base of 20 million — five years out from the planned 2024 launch. For Vision Pro to be successful, it needs to replace personal computers, said Nicole Peng, senior vice president, mobility, at Canalys. She said that’s the value proposition Vision Pro has set up, which is different from what Xreal or Meta offer. Xreal rebranded from Nreal in late May. “Nreal, Xreal glasses still need to connect with a PC or a phone,” Peng said. “That means when you’re using it it’s likely to [need] a wire to connect with either of the devices.” Right now, the company’s primary product — Xreal Air — allows wearers of the headsets to see an enlarged version of a computer, gaming device or smartphone screen via a connected cord. A forthcoming accessory called Xreal Beam, priced at $109, allows Xreal Air users to connect wirelessly to a device. Deliveries are set to begin in the second half of July, according to the official website. People in 85 countries signed up to be notified about the Xreal Beam, Jin said. He said the company primarily sells to the U.S., Japan and South Korea, with China accounting for less than a third of sales. In August, Xreal plans to expand online shipping to parts of Europe, Jin told CNBC. Currently customers in the region can only pay for international shipping via Amazon.com in the U.S. Xreal Air resembles a pair of ordinary sunglasses, and claims to weigh just 79 grams (less than 3 ounces). Apple has not released such figures for Vision Pro. CNBC’s Steve Kovach described the headset as “a bit heavy and uncomfortable” after 30 minutes. The device is strapped to the head, like goggles.

The vote will allow Nikola to raise additional funds to support the launch of a fuel-cell-powered electric semitruck and the buildout of a hydrogen refueling network in the U.S. and Canada. Fortinet — Shares of the cybersecurity stock plummeted 25.1% following a mixed second-quarter report and outlook. Fortinet posted 38 cents in adjusted earnings per share, while analysts polled by Refinitiv expected 34 cents per share. The company also reported $1.29 billion in revenue, slightly under the consensus forecast of $1.3 billion. Guidance for the current quarter was similarly mixed. Opendoor Technologies — The real-estate tech stock tumbled 26.3% after telling investors to expect revenue to come in lower than analysts expect in the current quarter. Opendoor said to expect between $950 million and $1 billion, while analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated $1.36 billion. DraftKings — The sports-betting stock climbed 5.8% on a strong quarterly report. DraftKings reported a loss of 17 cents per share, less than the 25 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $875 million, better than the $764 million anticipated. Airbnb — Shares shed 0.5% following the company’s second-quarter earnings announcement. Although Airbnb’s earnings and revenue came above analysts’ estimates, its nights and experiences bookings missed expectations. Dropbox — The online collaboration platform added 5.9% after beating Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Dropbox posted 51 cents in adjusted earnings per share, while analysts surveyed by Refinitiv anticipated 46 cents. Revenue came in at $623 million, beating the $614 million estimate. Redfin — The real estate tech stock dropped 24.4% on soft third-quarter revenue guidance. The company forecast third-quarter revenue between $265 million and $279 million, lower than the $288 million expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv. Corsair Gaming — Shares fell 9.8% even though the gaming company had a strong quarter and reaffirmed full-year guidance. Earnings per share came in line with the FactSet consensus estimate at 9 cents. Corsair beat expectations for revenue, posting $325.4 million while analysts forecast $322.8 million.

But as Apple explained, a drop of 5.49% would actually be an improvement from the December quarter, because Apple’s results in the December quarter were artificially boosted by the fact that there was an extra week. In other words, December 2022′s year-over-year revenue performance was even worse than it looked. In addition, Covid lockdowns at factories in China were a big factor in the shortfall, but Apple said on Thursday that its production was back to a level it was comfortable with, suggesting that supply won’t be as big a drag on the March quarter as it was in December. “For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming,” Maestri said. Services revenue was one of the few pleasant surprises for Apple on Thursday, as its $20.77 billion in sales beat Wall Street consensus expectations. The segment includes App Store, warranties, iCloud, and Apple Music, among other things. Last year, Apple reported $19.82 billion in services revenue in the March quarter, so the company is suggesting an increase from there, even though executives said it remains a tough environment with decreased gaming and advertising sales. “For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds,” Maestri said. This represents a significant shift for the iPad, which was Apple’s fastest growing hardware business during the December quarter, spiking nearly 30% on a year-over-year basis to $9.4 billion in sales. Now Apple is suggesting the business will go from 30% growth to more than a 10% decline. In contrast, the Mac business declined nearly 29% during the December quarter, but Cook told analysts it was partially because of when the company released new laptops, and Apple announced new Mac desktops and laptops in January. Mac sales will be down at least 10% in the March quarter, based on these comments, but will likely improve. “We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $14.9 billion.” Apple’",error,513

It’s because of that unwavering commitment and history of service that Congressman Correa brought him aboard his team — to work by his side in his fight for the hard-working taxpayers he represents right here in Orange County,” the statement said. Public disclosures show that as recently as 2022, Muñoz lobbied Congress on the very areas which Correa is now overseeing. Correa’s ability to influence the agenda while in the minority is limited, but ranking members can often serve an important role in pushing back on the majority or in messaging to industry and agencies. Some fear that should the Democrats take back the House, it will now be harder to replace Correa with a more reform-minded Democrat. The disclosures do not indicate which specific bills Muñoz lobbied on. However, in filings across multiple quarters, he is listed as one of three lobbyists for Federal Street Strategies who worked on issue areas related to several of the bills that passed through the House Judiciary Committee while Cicilline led the antitrust subcommittee. For example, in the second and third quarters of 2021, Muñoz is listed as one of three lobbyists who engaged with Congress on behalf of Apple in areas related to the six bills that made up Cicilline’s cornerstone package on tech antitrust. That includes the period right around the time that package passed through the House Judiciary Committee in June 2021. Lobbying disclosures by Federal Street indicate that Muñoz was similarly one of three lobbyists who engaged on behalf of Amazon on areas related to those bills during the same period. Among the bills in the package were the Ending Platform Monopolies Act, which could lead to a breakup of dominant online platforms by prohibiting them from owning business lines that present a conflict of interest.  They also included the American Choice and Innovation Online Act, which would prohibit top platforms from favoring their own products over rivals’ in their marketplaces or discriminating against competitors. It was the precursor to a Senate version of the bill that gained steam last year by passing out of the Judiciary committee in that chamber. But it ultimately failed to reach the floor after significant tech lobbying. Again, it’s unclear from the filing which exact bills Muñoz lobbied on. The tech industry and its trade groups have spent millions on lobbying, including against antitrust bills that would restrict key elements of their business models. Apple notably ramped up its overall lobbying spending in 2022, reaching $9.4 million,",error,513
385,"�Foxconn’s decision to establish a JV in India responds to two key trends – one of them being the market’s growing role as a consumer electronics manufacturing hub, the second one being India’s ambitions – mirroring other major markets such as the US, the EU and Mainland China - to develop its domestic semiconductor industry through public subsidies and regulatory incentives,” BMI’s Perez said. This month, Foxconn pulled out of its joint venture with Vedanta. The two sides “mutually agreed to part ways,” Foxconn said in a statement at the time. “There was recognition from both sides that the project was not moving fast enough, there were challenging gaps we were not able to smoothly overcome, as well as external issues unrelated to the project,” Foxconn said. Deadlocked talks with European chipmaker STMicroelectronics, which was the technology partner for the project, was one major reason for the venture’s failure, Reuters reported this month. Foxconn and Vedanta wanted to license the technology from STMicro and India wanted the firm to have a stake in the joint venture, but the European chipmaker did not, Reuters reported. Foxconn’s hurdles point to a broader issue — it’s hard for newcomers to get into semiconductor manufacturing. The manufacturing of chips is dominated by one player — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC — which has a 59% market share in the foundry segment, according to Counterpoint Research. TSMC doesn’t design its own chips. Instead, it makes these components for other companies like Apple. TSMC has had more than two decades of experience and billions of dollars of investment to get to where it is. TSMC also relies on a complex supply chain of companies that make critical tools to allow it to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world. Foxconn and Vedanta’s effort appeared to rely heavily on STMicro, but once the European company bailed, the joint venture was without much expertise in semiconductors. “Both companies... lacked the core competency of manufacturing a chip,” Counterpoint Research’s Shah said, adding that they were dependent on third-party technology and intellectual property. Foxconn’s attempts to crack the semiconductor space highlight how difficult it is for a new entrant to do so — even for a $47.9 billion giant. “The semiconductor market is highly concentrated",error,513
387," perfect storm for companies which have massively over-ordered and now are facing demand that is slightly lower than hoped so or expected, and that translated immediately to very high inventory levels, a lack of cash, and a lack of liquidity.” The e-bike industry has been plagued by recent bankruptcies of major players in the space. In July, Dutch e-bike firm VanMoof filed for protection from creditors. Administrators overseeing the bankruptcy process are exploring a number of options for VanMoof, including a potential asset sale to a third party so it can continue operations. Revonte, a Finnish e-bike firm, also filed for bankruptcy and said it is selling its intellectual property.  Roose said that his firm is unlike competitors in that it doesn’t manufacture bikes itself and therefore has a slimmer cost line. With some competing e-bike firms, “their cost base was way too high for their size,” Roose said, adding that VanMoof operated with far more employees than Cowboy despite boasting similar rates of revenue. Cowboy launched its new Cruiser e-bike with an upright seating position — known as the “Dutch” riding position — earlier this year.  The bike is intended to provide riders with “improved posture and increased visibility on the road,” according to the firm. But at an “introductory” price of $3,490, Cowboy’s e-bikes don’t come cheap. And on Aug. 1, the company raised prices of its belt-driven “Performance” configuration bikes to $3,790 from $3,490. E-bike firms have had to get more aggressive on pricing as the tide of venture capital that buoyed the industry in 2020 and 2021 has seeped out of the market with interest rates climbing higher. Still, though, Roose said he’s keeping his eye squarely focused on the long-term potential of e-bikes — driving sustainability with less cars on the street — rather than the short-term market outlook. “The demand for e-bikes in general is really strong and it’s been growing year-on-year,” Roose said. “In 2023, there’s been a bit of a slowdown, but the mid to long-term demand for micro mobility in general is as strong as it’s ever been and we’re super bullish.” Revenues have risen by 38% year-",error,513
394,"omi took the wraps off of a prototype set of augmented reality glasses. That will mean more competition for HTC. In the second quarter of 2022, the company shipped over 100,000 XR devices, according to data from Counterpoint Research, up by 158% from 40,000 shipments in the same period a year prior. But its market share remains relatively small. If anything, Wang thinks that moves from Apple, Meta, Samsung and others in the space will boost the overall adoption of mixed reality devices, which she sees as a boon to HTC’s business. “It’s really proven that our direction is correct,” she said. “Competition is always good.” Once a major player in the smartphone market, HTC has staked its future on the merging of virtual and physical worlds. In January, the company launched its Vive XR Elite device, a lightweight headset focused on gaming, fitness and productivity, at a $1,099 price point. HTC sold a chunk of its smartphone business to Google in 2018 for $1.1 billion. The bet long term is that these devices will be how we interact with a mass-scale virtual world known as the “metaverse.” HTC has its own so-called metaverse, named HTC Viverse, and the company talked up its ambitions in this area at the show this week. “The metaverse is kind of growing in a state where so many social media companies and walled garden companies are trying to build it out themselves,” Shen Ye, HTC’s global head of product, told CNBC. “Our goal is to make sure it’s as open and interconnected as possible.” Buzz around the metaverse has died down lately, as the initial hype surrounding Meta’s involvement has been wearing off. Worldwide shipments of VR headsets as well as augmented reality devices sales sank over 12% last year, according to IDC data. Companies have instead steered toward artificial intelligence, the new in-vogue tech topic that has been catapulted to the top of industry insiders’ favorite trends by ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot. At MWC, South Korean telecoms firm SKTelecom had a big sign that read “AI METAVERSE.” Donning one of HTC’s XR devices, users can immerse themselves in virtual spaces or interact with 3D objects in the physical space surrounding them.

407," home. It was Apple’s first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since 2019 and the biggest annual quarterly revenue drop since September 2016.  Cook told CNBC that the miss was partially because of a strong dollar. He said Apple grew in most markets if you controlled for 800 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. A basis point equals 0.01 of a percentage point.    Cook added that the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Max was significantly reduced during the quarter, meaning there were fewer phones to sell to customers. The primary iPhone assembly plant in China was affected by Covid lockdowns during the quarter, a warning that had been made to investors in November.   “We put out an update on that on November 6th and it lasted through most of December,” Cook said “So we had a big hole there.”  The Apple CEO said that production is now back to levels Apple is comfortable with.  Cook said the challenging macroeconomic environment affected iPhone sales, Mac sales, and sales of wearables like the Apple Watch. IPhone and Mac sales were down year over year. Apple’s other products category, which includes headphones like AirPods and wearables like Apple Watch, declined over 8%.  Cook said Mac sales fell because it was difficult to compare the quarter to last year’s period, in which the company released new high-end MacBook Pro laptops. There were no similar launches during this year’s December quarter, he noted.   The report offered investors a few bright spots. First, Apple disclosed that it has 2 billion active devices, including iPhones, Macs, Apple Watches, and other products, an increase from the 1.8 billion active devices it revealed last year in January.   The number is important to investors because it summarizes the company’s global reach and suggests upside if the company can better monetize those customers through services or other additional products.   “We attribute that to having a lot of switchers and a lot of first-time buyers in the case of the Apple Watch,” Cook said. “And so obviously you need to bring in people that are not currently active on a device in order to grow.”  IPad sales grew nearly 30% year over year after it released a low-end, inexpensive model as well as a new high-end model during the quarter.

The 2022 results among big companies for managing their cash and investments were all over the mark, for a variety of reasons. Take Amazon’s $16.8 billion 2022 non-cash loss, not related to any bad bond bets but a big investment stake in electric truck maker Rivian. Ford had a tough 2022 on the “other income” line of its income statement, losing more than $5 billion, according to the company’s annual 10-K filing. Ford, which did not respond to a request for comment, reported a $7.4 billion write down on its own Rivian stake.   But rising interest rates didn’t seem to hurt giant chipmaker Intel, which reported that it made a profit of $1.17 billion on “interest and other” investment income. It also reported a $427 million gain on equity investments — reflecting the successful spinoff of Mobileye. Intel reported $28.3 billion of cash and investments as of Dec. 31. For some corporations, the big recent moves have been shoring up where the cash on deposit is being held. The latest CNBC CFO Council quarterly survey showed that even as the majority of companies didn’t face a threat from the regional banking crisis, 23% of CFOs surveyed said they had moved some money out of regional banks and into large multinationals in the last month. Still, most (73%) said they are “not at all concerned” about the safety of company deposits. At Amazon, which declined comment but referred CNBC to the correct portion of its 10-K filing, the largest part of its $70 billion cash and securities pile is tied up in money market funds that pay an average interest rate of 4.2%.

424,",” former Twitter head of trust and safety Yoel Roth wrote this month in the New York Times. Twitter and Apple have been partners for years. In 2011, Apple deeply integrated tweets into its iOS operating system. Tweets that function as official company communications are regularly posted under Apple CEO Tim Cook’s account. Apple has advertised new iPhones and its big launch events on Twitter. But the relationship appears poised to change as Musk moves to generate a larger bulk of income from subscriptions. Twitter reported $5.08 billion in revenue in 2021. If half of that comes from subscriptions in the future, as Musk has said is the goal, hundreds of millions of dollars would end up going to Apple and Google — a small amount for them, but a potentially massive hit for Twitter. This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he’s bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst’s best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks ‘alpha’ opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside One of Apple’s main rules is that digital content — game coins, or an avatar’s outfit, or a premium subscription— that’s purchased inside an iPhone app, has to use Apple’s in-app purchasing mechanism, in which Apple bills the user directly. Apple takes 30% of sales, decreasing to 15% after a year for subscriptions, and pays the remainder to the developer. Companies such as Epic Games, Spotify, and Match Group lobby against Apple and Google’s rules as part of the Coalition for App Fairness. Microsoft and Meta have also filed briefs in court criticizing the system and made public remarks aimed at app stores. One option for Musk is to take an approach similar to what Spotify has done: Offer a lower $9.99 price on the web, where it doesn’t pay Apple a cut, and then users simply log in to their existing account inside the app. Users subscribing to a Premium subscription inside the iPhone app pay $12.99, effectively covering Apple’s fees. Or Twitter could go further, like Netflix, which stopped offering subscriptions through Apple entirely in 2018. Musk could sell Twitter Blue on the company’s website at a cheaper price and tweet to his over 118 million followers that Blue is only available on Twitter.com. It might work and could help cut Apple out of any fees. But that also means Twitter would",error,513
424," have to remove many options for informing users about the subscription inside the app, where they’re most likely to make a purchasing decision. And Apple has detailed rules about what apps can link to when telling users about alternative ways to pay. As Netflix’s app says: “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle.” Musk faces the power of Apple and Google and their ability to decline to approve or even pull apps that violate their rules over content moderation and harmful content. It’s happened before. Apple said in a letter to Congress last year that it had removed over 30,000 apps from its store over objectionable content in 2020. If app store-related problems strike Twitter, it could be “catastrophic,” according to the former Twitter head of trust and safety Roth. Twitter lists app review as a risk factor in filings with the SEC, he noted. Apple and Google can remove apps for various reasons, like issues with an app’s security and whether it complies with the platform billing rules. And app reviews can delay release schedules and cause havoc whenever Musk wants to launch new features. In the past few years, the app stores have started more closely scrutinizing user-generated content that starts shading into violent speech or social networks that lack content moderation. There’s precedent for a complete ban. Apple and Google banned Parler, a much smaller and conservative-leaning site, in 2020 after posts on the site promoted the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and included calls for violence. In Apple’s case, the decision to ban high-profile apps is made by a group called the Executive Review Board, which is led by Schiller — the Apple executive who deleted his Twitter account over the weekend. Although Apple approved Truth Social, Trump’s social networking app, in February, it took longer for Google Play to approve it. The company told CNBC in August that the social network lacked “effective systems for moderating user-generated content” and therefore violated Google’s Play Store terms of service. Google eventually approved the app in October, saying that apps need to “remove objectionable posts such as those that incite violence.” Musk reportedly fired many of Twitter’s contact content moderators this month. Apple and Google have been careful while banning apps like Parler, pointing to specific guideline violations like screenshots of the offending posts, instead of citing broad political reasons or pressure",error,513
426," In fact, Apple’s app review department is unlikely to pull Twitter over content. While Apple regularly bans apps over questionable content, they are rarely big brand names such as Twitter — they’re usually smaller, lesser-known apps. Apple’s rules for apps with significant user-generated content, such as Twitter, focus less on specific kinds of infringing content and more on whether the app has a content filtering system or content moderation procedures. Twitter has both, although Musk’s recent cuts to Twitter’s staff could hurt its ability to flag problem posts. But Apple would be much more likely to pull the Twitter app if Twitter tries to cut Apple out of its platform fees. It’s happened before. In 2020, Fortnite added a system inside its iPhone app that allowed users to buy in-game coins directly from Epic Games, cutting out the 30% of sales that Apple typically takes. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store the same day. The episode kicked off a legal battle, which Apple won on most counts but is currently in appeals. Google takes a similar cut for Android apps sold through its Play Store but also allows other Android app stores to exist and allows people to “sideload” apps directly onto their phones, while Apple has an exclusive lock on all iPhone app distribution. Musk has good business reasons to pick this fight. In particular, Musk wants Twitter to make much more money from direct subscriptions and not advertising. But Apple’s 30% cut of purchases made inside apps is a major hurdle for a company that is slashing costs and has a significant debt load. So Musk could pull an Epic Games move and enable direct billing, spurring Apple to take action, while at the same time framing the debate around free speech. If that happened, as DeSantis suggested, perhaps Congress would start asking questions. Apple would become a football in political debates. Executives could be forced to testify or provide written responses. At the very least, you’d have lawmakers such as Vance using the words “monopoly” and “Apple” in the same sentence. That’s a risk to Apple’s brand. Debate over these topics could reenergize pending regulation such as the Open Markets Act which threatens its control over the App Store and its significant profits. The last time Apple pulled an app that was popular with conservatives for lack of content moderation was Parler in January 2021. It was restored in April. In the interim",error,513
427,"se, usually citing a rule, but not elaborating on what specifically an app maker should do to fix the problem — for example, Apple might say the app has a “metadata problem” or uses a banned application programming interface. Musk also chafes under Apple’s platform fees, which are between 15% and 30% of total digital sales, like the $8 Twitter Blue subscription that Musk has said could be a major product for the company. Musk said it was a “de facto global tax” on the internet before he took over Twitter, but in his new role as an app owner, he has attacked it with increasing vigor. This week, he tweeted and deleted a meme that suggested he would rather “go to war” than pay 30% to Apple. Apple earlier this week declined to comment on the alleged threat of suspension or Apple’s ad spend with Twitter. Tesla and Apple are neighbors in the San Francisco Bay Area, which means that they have competed for talent for more than a decade. Now that competition has extended into Texas. Both companies need mechanical engineers, industrial designers, materials science and battery experts, and skilled software engineers. Apple has also invested heavily in developing its own electric autonomous vehicle technology. If the so-called “Apple Car” ever came to market, Tesla and Apple would be direct competitors. In that context, early examples of Musk tweaking Apple could be seen as friendly rivalry. When Tesla was still an underdog and upstart, Musk used to call Apple the “Tesla graveyard,” according to multiple former Tesla employees who spoke with CNBC. Internally, he would encourage unhappy Tesla workers to go apply for a cushy job at Apple. He eventually brought this up in a public interview, saying that Apple hired people who were fired from Tesla. In 2018, dozens of former Tesla employees landed at Apple, including some who were laid off and others who simply jumped ship from Tesla. At that time, the EV maker’s North American PR team told CNBC, “Tesla is the hard path. We have 100 times less money than Apple, so of course they can afford to pay more.” One of the most notable people to switch sides was Doug Field, who started at Apple, joined Tesla and then rejoined Apple. Now he works for a more direct Tesla competitor, Ford. Last summer, Musk laid out some of his problems with the way Apple does business on a Tesla earnings call, although he was careful not to name the",error,513
427," company at first. He started by criticizing the amount of cobalt, a mineral linked to human rights abuses, which Apple uses to make batteries in its devices. In 2018, Musk pledged to eliminate Tesla’s use of cobalt in its production entirely. Tesla has shifted a significant portion of its vehicles to a type of battery called an LFP, or lithium iron phosphate battery. However, it has not managed to eliminate need of cobalt completely yet. In its most recent Impact Report, Tesla wrote, “we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.” On the charging front, Tesla is experimenting with ways to give other EV drivers access to its network. But the company hasn’t opened up charging on a mainstream basis yet. Later in the earnings call, Musk criticized Apple’s “walled garden” business model when answering a question about when Tesla chargers might be able to charge other vehicle makes. “I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy,” Musk said. “It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is used by some companies.” In case anybody missed the reference to Apple’s App Store, which Apple maintains as the exclusive way to distribute apps to its devices, Musk then faked a cough and said, “Apple.” Musk also has used Apple’s name to generate buzz. In September, when Apple announced satellite connectivity in its new iPhone 14 models (with satellites being operated by GlobalStar) Musk suggested that Apple had looked into using Starlink, which uses different technology. “We’ve had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity,” Musk tweeted, complimenting the iPhone team. Apple has never acknowledged any negotiations or even discussion with SpaceX. Have Apple CEO Tim Cook and Musk ever spoken in depth? According to Cook, the answer is no. The Apple chief said in a 2021 podcast that he has “great admiration and respect” for Tesla, but that he had never spoken with Elon Musk. The two were photographed feet apart with other business leaders at a 2016 meeting with former President Donald Trump at Trump Tower. But Musk claims that Apple declined his proposal to acquire Tesla years ago, when the EV maker’s market cap stood",error,513
437," for how far consumers (and companies) can or will go – at least for now – in swapping out human narrators for computer-generated voices.  “People are highly sensitive to sound,” said David Ciccarelli, CEO of Voices, the largest voiceover marketplace. While your eye can discern movement at 24 frames per second, the ear can do so at a fidelity of 20,000 times per second. And he added, “Because most people listen to audiobooks with earbuds, there is an even greater sense of intimacy.”  The quality of the narration is a significant issue as well, as it hinges largely on the listener’s sense of connection with the voice. “Nearly 60% of listeners ditched an audiobook because they didn’t enjoy the narrator … people like listening to other people, especially when stories are told,” Ciccarelli said. Getting AI voice to not only sound human but connect with listeners isn’t so easy to do. Voicing is, after all, acting, and the art of it is difficult to replicate. “What humans can do best that AI can’t is timing,” Ciccarelli said, “be it the awkward pause or a hilarious sense of comedic timing, it’s difficult for an AI voice to get this right out-of-the-box.”  Speed can be an issue for AI too, since the pace of a narration will vary in accordance with what is happening in the content of what’s being read. We read some parts of a plot or an argument naturally at different speeds than other parts, but that’s because we understand what we’re reading. AI doesn’t. “Professional narrators know when to speed it up and then revert to a normal reading pace,” Ciccarell said. They also know how to pronounce words and don’t have an issue with homographs.   AI voice will get better, and listener resistance to it will, accordingly, shrink. The question with game-changing new technologies isn’t even if, but when. Ciccarelli knows that. “The industry recognized that change is in the air and that AI, now that it’s here, will only get better,” he said. “It’s gone from laughable to passable, and now, it’s getting better all the time,�",error,513
437,"� he added. Voice cloning of professional voice artists is foreseeable, underlining the importance of going down that road ethically and protecting the work of voice actors’ rights to “credit, consent, and compensation.”  Even with AI voice, there is nominally a voice actor somewhere in the process. Speech-to-speech systems have become popular in media because they enable even higher fidelity emotional content to be expressed through synthetic voices, according to Bret Kinsella, Founder and CEO of Voicebot.ai. But these still require a voice actor whose voice is then transformed into another voice.  For some voice actors, the choice is being made to stay away. “I refuse VO work that states they’ll take my voice and make an AI model from it,” said Brad Ziffer, a voice actor with 14 years of experience. “The best way to protect myself is to just stay away,” he said. In the past two decades, narrators have gone from reading photocopies of printed books and editing out page turn sounds to reading on a tablet; from recording exclusively in studios to recording many titles at home. Audio editors have gone from splicing tape with razors to editing digital files by rolling back and recording over mistakes. Publishers have gone from delivering content on cassette to CD to digitally. “With each transition there comes fear and uncertainty, but through each transition we have learned, grown, adapted, and thrived,” said Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association. Cobb says the growth of the audio industry is extending the range of opportunities, and new technology is part of it. As listenership grows and the appetite for audio content grows, publishers are publicizing originals and audio-first works that allow them to stretch their creative approaches and convince more consumers to be enticed to try audio, he said. “AI technology can help workflows. AI is not a new tool for voice talent, producers, and publishers, many of whom use it to improve their quality control in post-production,” he said.  As of last week, that approach to voice production now includes The Beatles. This evolution will inevitably include the risks posed by AI. “Regardless of profession the fear of someone’s livelihood being displaced by a machine is real,” Cobb said. “But I know I am not alone in appreciating the deep, rich, emotionally intelligent performance of my favorite narrator as they perform words in the",error,513
437," effective oral tradition of human storytelling,” he added. The biggest change taking place right now is focused on text and image, not voice, with generative AI chatbots led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT taking over more writing, including novels, and generative AI graphics models producing images. Kinsella noted that AI voice played a foundational role in the integration of AI into daily life at an earlier point. “Voice was actually the previous wave of AI…Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant all use synthetic voices,” he said. The input and output in these devices evolved to be voice-to-voice, and eventually, text-based AI forms may follow a similar development pattern. “ChatGPT brings back the text-first approach. Some use cases will remain text while others will naturally shift to voice-input first and then audio (synthetic voice) output over time,” Kinsella said. “ChatGPT’s mobile app enables voice input today but it does not have a text-to-speech for listenable responses. That will surely come for some use cases.” When it comes to publishing, audiobooks are a rising but still relatively small slice of the overall publishing pie, and the additional time and cost requirements will continue to influence decision-making.   “Some publishers prefer not to pay the additional cost and some authors are also reticent to take on that cost themselves,” Kinsella said. “If the author records it in their own voice, there still is some studio and editing cost, and it can take many days to complete.”  AI can make these barriers a little easier to get across.  Apple developed a program that mitigates or eliminates the friction in audiobook production as part of its effort to have more audiobooks for readers. Authors can have their audiobooks created at no initial direct cost and no time commitment. The companies that provide the service for Apple authors take a fee for every audiobook sold. Amazon — which owns Audible, one of the dominant players in the sector — has a similar audiobook recording service, but it uses professional voice actors and not synthetic speech. “It would be logical for it to add voice clones or its Poly synthetic voices to this type of service, but I am not aware of any activity on this front,” Kinsella said. Apple declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to requests for information about its",error,513
437," audiobook offerings. Ziffer is naturally concerned about the role AI will play in his profession. “I’m very cautious regarding the world of AI. I believe it has great potential … but it can be easy to abuse. Right now, I still believe a real human VO has no equal. Synthesized voice algorithms aren’t there yet to be able to fully reproduce all the nuances of the human voice,” he said. With AI voice needing to conquer natural voice inflection, comprehension/interpretation of reading material, and the ability to bring emotion, and change of emotion, as the material dictates. As companies are beginning to experiment with AI, Ziffer said he would not be surprised if his income is impacted in some way. But he added, “I’ve yet to find a client who tells me they’ve chosen an AI voice over hiring me. Ziffer expects AI to be most widely used among companies with smaller budgets or those focused on e-learning texts. “But for those who want the best, the job is best left to humans,” he said. “Living, breathing actors who have real feelings, a brain and emotions and can breathe life into work are the best fit for a dynamic and believable VO. It may be easy to clone anything with technology, but nothing beats the real deal.”  Andrea Collins, a voice actor with fifteen years of experience, also takes the view that AI will provide necessary tradeoffs for some companies. “I think it will become a great tool for clients who are looking for a project to be completed super quickly and for a reasonable price,” she said. Texts where companies will forego the sound of a real voice for speed include presentations and compliance materials. Speed is an inevitable factor with general audiobook production too. “In terms of audiobooks, I’m sure it will take a chunk out of the space as an AI voice can tackle 30,000 words a lot faster than a human can,” Collins said. She has yet to see AI have a significant impact on her finances, but she added, “My guess is that day will come. So rather than putting my head in the sand, I’m trying to get ahead of it” Collins is taking steps to have her voice cloned this year. “Most of the established artists I know are doing the same thing. My hope is that my cloned voice",error,513

In the very unlikely worst-case scenario for Apple, if alternative app stores in Europe resulted in a total loss of App Store sales in the region, it would only dent Apple’s services business by about 4%, its total revenue by about 1%, and its earnings per share by 2.5%, according to a Morgan Stanley estimate published Wednesday. Apple reported $394 billion in total sales, with $78 billion coming from services, in its 2022 fiscal year, which ended in September. The U.S. has proposed similar legislation, the Open App Markets Act, which is currently being debated in Congress. Even if the EU law forces Apple to break the App Store’s hold on distribution, the company could still find a way to take fees from apps distributed in other ways. In a trial with Epic Games last year over App Store policies, Apple representatives argued that App Store fees pay for intellectual property — the software tools developers use to make iPhone apps — and not just distribution. Apps distributed through the web would still presumably use Apple’s programming interfaces. Apple has also argued that the App Store is important for customer security, because software that Apple hasn’t checked could steal personal data or payment information. So if Apple does open up the iPhone to third-party apps or app stores, there are likely to be security requirements for developers. For instance, Apple could require developers who want to distribute apps outside of the App Store to apply for programs to get access to the specific programming interfaces that make it possible, or to certify that they comply with certain security requirements. It could also require those app makers to display a warning pop-up if their apps aren’t distributed through Apple. Apple’s actions in South Korea provide an instructive example. Earlier this year, a legal ruling forced Apple to allow apps distributed through the App Store to bill their customers directly, instead of using Apple’s own payment system.  But Apple still found a way to collect fees there. Apple required apps that took advantage of the new policy to pay a commission of 26%, only a slight discount on the standard 30%. Apple did this by requiring app makers to provide a report in spreadsheet format describing each in-app transaction during the month, then collecting a cut from those purchases. Apple reserved the right to audit developer books. Apple was able to enforce its system because it still controlled the App Store for distribution, and developers had to agree to its terms of service to get any distribution at all.

House Republican leaders want to look into whether tech firms have been censoring conservative voices, according to a tech industry ally of McCarthy’s who declined to be named to speak freely about private conversations with GOP leadership. Jordan has already subpoenaed the CEOs of Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, demanding communications between the companies and the U.S. government to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.” Jordan has repeatedly questioned the usefulness of antitrust bills over the years, preferring to focus on what he views as censorship of conservative voices by the major tech platforms. In June 2021, during a 23-hour markup of a package of antitrust bills supported by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Buck, Jordan said the legislation didn’t do enough to address those censorship concerns. Buck, meanwhile, previously told CNBC that problems with bias on platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are just a “symptom of the overall problem” of inadequate competition online. That’s because there’s a few dominant companies that run the largest platforms. Representatives for Meta and Microsoft referred CNBC to previous statements where they said they were cooperating with Jordan’s subpoena. All the other tech giants mentioned in this article didn’t respond to requests for comment. Last year, advocates for reforming antitrust laws were optimistic about the chances of passing major legislation that would strengthen competition rules for online shopping platforms, mobile apps and other relatively new technologies. The leading proposal at the time was the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, championed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, then ranking member on the full committee. Though it passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee and similar legislation advanced out of the House Judiciary Committee, it didn’t get to the floor of either chamber for a vote. An antitrust bill Buck introduced in May drew bipartisan support from opposite ends of the political spectrum: Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., among others.

And Upgrade, which is led by LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche, offers 4.56% for customers with a minimum balance of $1,000. “It’s really a trade-off for consumers, between safety or the appearance of safety, and yield,” Laplanche told CNBC. Upgrade, which is based in San Francisco, and most other fintech players keep customer deposits with institutions backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., so consumer funds are safe up to the $250,000 threshold. SoFi is the rare example of a fintech with a banking charter, which it acquired last year. It offers a high-yield savings product with a 4.2% APY. The story isn’t just about rising interest rates. Across the emerging fintech spectrum, companies like Upgrade are, intentionally or not, taking advantage of a moment of upheaval in traditional finance. On Monday, First Republic became the third American bank to fail since March, following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All three saw depositors rush for the exits as concerns about a liquidity crunch led to a cycle of doom. Shares of PacWest and other regional banks have plummeted this week, even after First Republic’s orchestrated sale to JPMorgan Chase was meant to signal stability in the system. After the collapse of SVB, Laplanche said Upgrade’s banking partners came to the company and asked it to step up the inflow of funds, an apparent effort to stanch the withdrawals at smaller banks. Upgrade farms out the money it attracts to a network of 200 small- and medium-sized banks and credit unions that pay the company for the deposits. For well over a decade, before the recent jump in rates, savings accounts were dead money. Borrowing rates were so low that banks couldn’t profitably offer yield on deposits. Also, stocks were on such a tear that investors were doing just fine in equities and index funds. A subset of those with a stomach for risk went big in crypto. As the price of bitcoin soared, a number of crypto exchanges and lenders began mimicking the banks’ savings model, offering very high yield (up to 20% annually) for investors to store their crypto. Those exchanges are now bankrupt following the crypto industry’s meltdown last year, and many thousands of clients lost their funds. There is some potential instability for fintechs",error,513

Many of them, including Upgrade and Affirm, partner with Cross River Bank, which serves as the regulated bank for companies that don’t have charters, allowing them to offer lending and credit products. Last week, Cross River was hit with a consent order from the FDIC for what the agency called “unsafe or unsound banking practices.” Cross River said in a statement that the order was focused on fair lending issues that occurred in 2021, and that it “places no limitations on our extensive existing fintech partnerships or the credit products we presently offer in partnership with them.” While fintechs broadly are under far less regulatory pressure than crypto companies, the FDIC’s action suggests that regulators are beginning to pay closer attention to the kinds of products that high-yield accounts are designed to complement. Still, the emerging group of high-yield savings products are much more mainstream than what the crypto platforms were promoting. That’s largely because the deposits come with government-backed insurance protections, which have a long history of safety. They’re also not designed to be big profit centers. Rather, by offering high yields for consumers who have long housed their money in stagnant accounts, tech and fintech companies are opening the door to potentially new customers. Apple has a whole suite of financial products, including a credit card and payments app, that pair smoothly with the savings account, which is only available to the 6 million-plus Apple Card holders. Those customers reportedly put in nearly $1 billion in deposits in the first four days the service was on the market. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. CEO Tim Cook said on the company’s earnings call Thursday that, “we are very pleased with the initial response on it. It’s been incredible.” Robinhood, meanwhile, wants more people to use its trading platform, and companies like LendingClub and SoFi are building relationships with potential borrowers. Laplanche said high-yield savings accounts, while compelling for the consumer, aren’t core to most fintech businesses but serve as an onboarding tool to more lucrative products, like consumer lending or conventional credit cards. “We started with credit,” Laplanche said. “We think that’s a better strategy.” SoFi launched its high-yield savings account in February of last year.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI has become a household name (and was No. 1 on CNBC’s Disruptor 50 list) with its ChatGPT program, and dollars are pouring into Nvidia, whose chips are used to power AI workloads at many of the companies taking advantage of the latest advancements. Nvidia shares soared 190% in the first half, lifting the 30-year-old company’s market cap past $1 trillion. “I think you’re going to continue to see tech dominate because we’re still all abuzz about AI,” said Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, in an interview with CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday. Talkington, whose firm holds Nvidia shares, said the chipmaker has a unique story, and that its growth is not shared across the industry. Rather, large companies working on AI have to spend heavily on Nvidia’s technology. “Nvidia not only owns the shovels and axes of this AI goldrush,” Talkington said. “They actually are the only hardware store in town.” Apple hasn’t seen gains quite so dramatic, but the stock is still up 50% this year, trading at a record and pushing the iPhone maker to a $3 trillion market cap. Apple still counts on the iPhone for the bulk of its revenue, but its latest jump into virtual reality with the announcement this month of the Vision Pro headset has helped reinvigorate investor enthusiasm. It was Apple’s first major product release since 2014, and will be available starting at $3,499 beginning early next year. That sounds like a lot, except when compared to the price tag for the initial Lisa computer, which Apple rolled out 40 years ago. That PC, named after co-founder Steve Jobs’ daughter, started at $10,000, keeping it far out of the hands of mainstream consumers. Apple’s revenue in 1983 was roughly $1 billion, or about the amount of money the company brought in on an average day in the first quarter of 2023 (Apple’s fiscal second quarter).

481," company needs to continue to buy new contracts. But Apple also examines the foreign exchange landscape when it launches new products, Maestri said, which led to these most recent price increases. “In some cases, for example, customers in international markets had to... they saw some price increases when we launched the new products, which is not something that, for example, U.S. customers have seen,” he said. “And that’s unfortunately the situation that we’re in right now with the strong dollar.” While recent currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar are causing some international buyers to pay more for an iPhone, there have been instances where Apple instead absorbed those costs. In 2019, when the U.S. dollar also saw a rise in value compared to other currencies, Apple adjusted foreign prices in some markets and reset them to near or the same as they had been in local currencies a year prior. However, the reason Apple did that was due to a decline in sales as a result of the price increase. For example, in Turkey, where the local lira had fallen 33% against the dollar in 2019, Apple’s sales were down $700 million. “We’ve decided to go back to [iPhone prices] more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas,” Cook told Reuters in an interview at the time. But in 2022, Apple says it has not seen any drop off in demand in those markets. Maestri noted that it saw double-digit growth in India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, and other countries even in their respective reported currencies. “It’s important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem, and in general, the strength of the brand,” Maestri said on the earnings call. “And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we’re making in a lot of markets around the world.” The U.S dollar has also risen steadily against the Chinese yuan over the six months, but there have been some signs that demand for the new Apple iPhones in the country might be weakening.

Here are some other comparisons of the prices of the base iPhone model between the 14 and 13 series: Australia: Japan: Germany: Apple isn’t the only company acknowledging the impact that currency headwinds are having on its business and pricing decisions. McDonald’s reported that currency dragged down its revenue by 7 percentage points, accounting for its 5% year-over-year decline in sales – which would have increased by 2% without the currency impact. With 60% of its sales coming from outside of the U.S., “Obviously, we’re translating those sales back into less U.S. dollars,” CFO Ian Borden said on the company’s earnings call last week. At P&G, the currency hit keeps getting bigger. The consumer products company reported a 6% decline in net sales due to “unfavorable foreign exchange,” which followed 3% and 4% negative currency impacts in each of its previous two quarters. The company had to raise its forecast for the exchange rate impact this year to $1.3 billion, with CFO Andre Schulten saying on the company’s earnings call last week, “Foreign exchange has continued its strong move against us.” James Quincey, CEO of Coca-Cola, which makes approximately 80% of its earnings outside the U.S., said the dollar has been a high single-digit headwind this year. “It’s likely to be a big headwind like that next year,” Quincey said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Coca-Cola, like Apple, has looked to offset some of the currency headwinds by raising prices, something it said it expects to continue to do as the U.S. dollar shows little signs of waning. “We are expecting pricing to be ahead of normal next year on top of what’s happened this year,” Quincey said. So far, Coca-Cola has not reported demand dropping as a result of the higher prices, but Quincey did say there are some potential consumer concerns on the horizon. “We do see our consumers are beginning to respond in a traditional way they would in a recession; delaying discretionary and high-ticket discretionary items and perhaps going",error,513
490," trackers … is there’s no way to prevent a victim from being stalked by one of these devices because they don’t control it. They don’t have any access to it. … Whether it’s a creep at the bar or an angry ex-partner, this is a new avenue that they can use to non-consensually track somebody without their knowledge,” said Adam Dodge, CEO of digital safety education company EndTAB and a member of the World Economic Forum’s Digital Justice Advisory Committee. Two women recently filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple alleging lack of protections the AirTag has against stalking. One victim discovered that her ex-boyfriend had planted an AirTag on her car, while the other found multiple AirTags in her child’s backpack that she suspects were placed by a former spouse. The lawsuit is a step in the right direction, Dodge said, because tech companies have historically been insulated by Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act but in this case, it is a product liability issue alleging inherently dangerous products lacking sufficient safeguards. He does give Apple credit for working to address these issues. “Apple’s already taken a lot of steps to make them less effective stalking tools. The problem is they’re really good at stalking people,” Dodge said. For that reason, the litigation could ultimately produce positive effects, even if it’s tough to beat big tech in court. “The history of litigation against big tech for these types of circumstances is not great. But I’m hopeful that they will have success from a product liability standpoint and as a result make these devices much safer to use,” he said. Whether successful or not, Dodge says it “sends a message to anyone developing hardware like this to prioritize user safety at the same level as they prioritize user growth and revenue.” Many victims of stalking cases were able to identify that they were being tracked when they received a sound notification on their iPhone that an AirTag was found moving with them. But there have been complaints about the low level of the sound. “It’s not a noise that you may not even take notice of it, so you have to be very cognizant that this is happening,” said Kathleen Moriarty, chief technology officer at the Center for Internet Security.  Apple has taken measures to raise the volume of the sound emitted from the AirTag, outlined in its February 2022",error,513
490," major announcement about several anti-stalking enhancements. Apple stated in that February update that is has been adjusting the tone sequence to use more of the loudest tones to make an unknown AirTag more easily findable. In its February update, Apple also included a new privacy warning during AirTag setup that explicitly states it’s a crime in many regions to use AirTags to track people without their consent. This warning function may have limited value, though. While it creates “friction” in the process for any user planning to put the AirTag to criminal use, it’s unlikely to stop those intent on a malicious action, according to Dodge. “It can’t hurt to say that, for Apple to put the warning out there, and perhaps for someone or a small group that would prevent them from misusing AirTags,” Dodge said, comparing the idea to how some algorithms now built into social media warn users a post they are about to publish is offensive or harassment. He said more important is the Apple announcement it is working with law enforcement on tracking AirTags back to perpetrators. “They have put out a very clear statement they will cooperate,” he said, and from what he has heard, Apple has backed that up. The challenge, according to Dodge, is that many people still don’t know that Apple will cooperate, including local law enforcement agencies, especially since historically, cooperation between law enforcement and big tech has not always been smooth. Apple referred all questions about AirTag to the policies and updates it outlined in its February update, and specifically the statement that the company is “committed to listening to feedback and innovating to make improvements that continue to guard against unwanted tracking.” It does not comment on pending litigation. Some of the biggest updates Apple and other manufacturers have made relate to apps dedicated to enhanced detection. “What we really need is really early warning detection, and we need to raise awareness in our community that this is a real risk,” Dodge said. The AirTag sound alert has been surpassed by Apple’s Precision Finding app for any iPhone 11 or later model, which physically guides users to an unknown AirTag, including showing the exact distance to the tag, and in addition to an AirTag separated from its original owner playing a sound to draw attention to it. For users of iOS 14.5 or later, an AirTag can also be recognized when the user arrives home, if that information is filled",error,513
490," out in an Apple My Card contact section, and if location services are turned on, which is the default setting. An unwanted AirTag, or a tag taken by mistake (say another family member’s tag) can also be detected at additional locations which a phone user frequents, such as a gym. Apple does not divulge a standard period of time when alerts commence for security reasons, with that randomized window of time ranging from 8 hours to 24 hours. “Precision Finding is great but what we also want is an earlier warning to victims,” Dodge said. “They’ve added Precision Finding, they’ve increased volume, they’ve lowered the time window to alert somebody if they’re being tracked, but we’d like to see them go further,” he said. Apple has made an effort to provide similar detection tech to Android phone users, with its Tracker Detect app available in the Google Play store. It lets Android users scan for items no longer with the original owner, however, it is not an automatic detection as on the iPhone. “More safety measures are needed, even for Apple, they need to find a better way to alert Android users if they are being tracked with an AirTag, because unlike the iPhone, they do not get the continual scanning,” Dodge said. He added this is particularly important because Android phones are more popular with underserved communities and people of lower-income, who should not be more at risk of stalking as a result of socioeconomics. In late 2020, Samsung launched a SmartThings Find feature in the SmartThings app, which enables Galaxy users to locate their lost phone. Samsung later added an update that allows users to scan for any unknown SmartTags near them with the Unknown Tag Search. Life360′s Tile introduced a similar update last March called Scan and Secure that lets both iOS and Android users detect any Tiles or Tile-enabled devices nearby. Once a user chooses to run Scan and Secure, the scan requires them to walk/move or drive a certain distance away from their original location for a maximum of 10 minutes of uninterrupted time until the scan is completed, a design the company says was informed by concern for potential victims of unwanted tracking. The company notes that the most common use case of domestic violence is 70% of stalking victims who know their abuser. While Dodge cited the importance of earlier detection, Life360 says it is a manual Bluetooth scanner because proactive alerts set to appear after a certain period of time",error,513
490," can put victims of domestic abuse in more danger, depending on the situation. Automatic alerts may not be in the best interest of someone who lives with their abuser and is trying to leave a dangerous situation can’t wait for an alert to inform them hours later that they’re being tracked. If you discover an unknown Bluetooth tagging device with you, there are ways to disable the device so it can no longer track your location. With AirTags, iPhone and NFC-capable smartphone users can disable the device by holding the top of their phone next to the white side of the AirTag. This will prompt a notification that brings users to the AirTag’s serial number, and they can then access instructions to disable the device. This function can be used to find an innocently lost AirTag and return to the owner if it has set the device to Lost Mode, or for an unwanted AirTag to be disabled. Apple offers step-by-step instructions on its website. Tile does as well. All AirTags can have batteries removed, which is not the case for all Tile and Tile-enabled devices. If a battery can be removed, that is a simple way to disable the device. For versions of Tile devices that are operated with non-replaceable batteries, the company recommends wrapping the device in several layers of foil or placing them in an electronic signal-blocking bag. While a user might be tempted to destroy an unwanted tag, especially if the battery cannot be removed, that’s not the best idea. “You could always take a hammer and destroy the thing, or put it in the garbage and send it to the dump, but from an evidentiary standpoint, if you’re going to law enforcement, obliterating the device means you might not have the serial number, and they’d want that,” Dodge said. The influx of stalking cases involving Bluetooth tagging devices emphasizes why people need to be vigilant about their privacy with these devices in the world, but these issues likely won’t dissuade prospective customers. “You could take a very hard line and just say technology isn’t good because it can be used for this type of tracking and not pursue the technology. But we’re in a situation where the use of it has already begun, so pulling back is difficult,” Moriarty said. With more safety features implemented into these devices, companies also need to balance security with usability. “If it becomes less useful to consumers because of limitations that",error,513

One of the biggest questions is how Apple will price its iPhones in a period of inflation around the world and macroeconomic uncertainty in some regions. Other consumer electronics, such as Sony’s Playstation 5, have seen price cuts. Apple’s least-expensive iPhone 13 model is the $699 iPhone 13 Mini, which is expected to be discontinued. That would make Apple’s mainline device, which is currently the iPhone 13, the least-expensive new model at $829, if its price doesn’t change. Some analysts also expect Apple to increase the price of its Pro models. Apple usually drops the price of older models when it releases new ones, giving more price-sensitive consumers an option. Apple is likely to show the eighth major new version of its watch on Wednesday. Last year, the Apple Watch Series 7 got a slightly larger screen, but the redesign did not significantly change the look and feel of the device, which has remained mostly the same since 2014. Expect more evolution this year, too. Apple is considering a body temperature sensor in the new devices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which could help with fertility and sleep tracking. Other sleep tracking features could include the ability to detect advanced sleep patterns or apnea. But the biggest Apple Watch Series 8 announcement could be a new “Pro” model with a bigger screen and more durable finish. Apple has previously released Apple Watches with pricey case materials such as gold, ceramic and titanium, and the new “Pro” model described by Bloomberg and Kuo could be one of the first high-end Apple Watches to gain additional features over its less-expensive siblings.

503,"Thursday Night Football” package to Amazon. The NFL last year renewed broadcast TV agreements with both Fox and CBS until 2030. Those deals guarantee exclusivity of local games. Fox and CBS have devised entire corporate strategies around that exclusivity, including buying local TV stations that line up with NFL markets where they own rights. For example, Fox owns local stations in locations including Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — all places with NFC teams, because Fox owns the NFC Sunday package. Sunday Ticket is also a U.S.-only product. It remains unclear what the NFL is willing to give Apple to enhance a deal beyond what it’s sold to DirecTV for the past 28 years. Still, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in July part of the benefit of selling to a streamer is to “innovate beyond where we are today.” Goodell said he plans to choose a new Sunday Ticket home by fall of this year. On that timeline, a winning bidder should be announced in the next 10 weeks. The NFL wants a buyer for Sunday Ticket to pay between $2 billion and $3 billion annually, CNBC has previously reported. That’s a significant increase from the $1.5 billion DirecTV has been paying since 2015. The league is also looking for a company to purchase a minority stake in NFL Media, which includes linear cable networks RedZone and NFL Network, as well as NFL.com. The NFL has been packing the minority stake with Sunday Ticket, though it could decide to sell each separately, Goodell said. Beyond its MLS partnership, Apple has been laying breadcrumbs that it wants to take a significant plunge into live sports. Apple struck a deal with Major League Baseball to carry exclusive Friday night games this season. And last month, the NFL announced Apple Music as the new partner for the Super Bowl halftime show. The longer the NFL waits to reach a deal, the less time a new owner of the rights will have to market the product for next season. DirecTV executives have been waiting for nearly two years for a new partner to be announced and have been surprised with how long it’s taken to find one, according to people familiar with the matter.

Pei wants to challenge Apple’s iPhone in the U.S. But it’s a steep hill to climb. “There’s a challenge with Android where iOS is just becoming more and more dominant. They have very strong lock-in with iMessage, with AirDrop, especially among Gen Z. So that’s a rising concern for me,” he said. “There might be a time where Apple is like 80% of the overall market and that just does not leave enough space for Android-based manufacturers to keep playing,” he said. Apple’s active installed base, which takes into account people who bought phones second-hand, surpassed 50% in the U.S. in the second quarter, surpassing Android, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Pei says he sympathized with Elon Musk, who as Twitter’s new CEO has put pressure on Apple over its App Store restrictions and 30% fee imposed on in-app purchases. He added that, in a couple of years’ time, Nothing may have to “have a serious think about this problem and how we tackle it.” “It’s going to create a ceiling to our growth,” Pei said. Pei said his firm has faced a plethora of challenges in bringing its products to market. One of the major setbacks it faced was when it approached Foxconn, Apple’s largest iPhone supplier, to manufacture its phones. According to Pei, Foxconn refused to do business with Nothing, citing past failures in the smartphone industry. “Every startup manufacturer has worked with Foxconn,” Pei said. “But when it was our turn, they said no because every startup that worked with them failed. And every time a startup failed, Foxconn lost money on it, they were not able to recoup their costs.” Foxconn was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Covid restrictions around the globe also presented a significant hurdle for the company.

[PRO] Buy the dipWhile investors are concerned about this biotech company’s potential loss of exclusivity and rising competition, Goldman Sachs sees an upside of more than 60%. The Wall Street bank believes investors should buy the dip and consider its “overlooked” pipeline.  Billionaire investor Ron Baron’s support of Elon Musk’s $56 billion compensation package almost feels like looking in the rearview mirror. Nonetheless, it’s a crucial intervention just ahead of next week’s vote on what would be corporate America’s biggest compensation package. Shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and ISS, have told investors to reject the award. In voiding the original package, the judge said the process was flawed because of the close relationship the compensation committee had with Musk. For example, Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla, sold some of her Tesla options for $280 million between 2021 and 2022 — a “life-changing” transaction, as she described it. Other members of the team had relationships with Musk going back 15 years or more and regularly vacationed together. The package has no salary or cash bonus and sets rewards based on Tesla’s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the 10 years from 2018. The court also found the defendants did not prove the package was necessary to retain Musk. At its height, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion in November 2021. Since then, the EV market has slowed and competition has intensified. Its current market cap is $560 billion. While Baron remains bullish and has made and expects to make a lot more money from Tesla, other investors expect the company’s stock to fall by as much as 30%. Who would bet against Musk? He took a niche vehicle manufacturer that has flirted with bankruptcy and challenged Detroit, and now plans to reinvent the EV maker into a leader in AI and robotics.

521," Cook said in April. “From an inflationary point of view and from an availability point of view.”  Another rising cost is related to the silicon shortage driven by China’s Covid-19 lockdowns during the first half of the year, and an overall dearth of less-advanced chips needed to complete its products. Cook said, however, that some components are getting less expensive. Apple may also be facing increased labor costs. The company is lifting pay for its corporate and retail employees in response to market conditions after some rivals, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, made changes to their compensation earlier this year in a bid to attract and retain top tech talent. “Other companies we follow are missing margins on cost inflation, but Apple views its basket of costs as relatively stable with lower commodity costs offsetting higher labor and freight costs,” Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a note after the earnings report. But increased costs aren’t the worst scenario for Apple. The bigger risk is if inflation and other macroeconomic conditions end up hurting demand for Apple’s products. Traditionally, during a recession or in the face of decreasing purchasing power, consumers put off purchases of durable goods, including electronics, economists say. In Apple’s case, this could mean that consumers who bought a phone two or three years ago might decide not to upgrade to the newest model this year and put the expense off until economic conditions are better. “Sometimes you just exercise some caution and postpone purchases,” said Jim Wilcox, a University of California Berkeley economist. “To kind of wait and see is a very sensible financial strategy.” Investors have largely become more comfortable that Apple customers are loyal and therefore likely to continue upgrading their devices regularly, but an inflation-related downturn could throw that conviction into question, hurting Apple’s earnings multiple. “In Apple’s case, they have a very strong ecosystem, their customers are very loyal,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said on CNBC this week. “But most of their revenue is generated from product sales and that’s driven largely by loyal customers, and if you get in a recession, the customers can delay purchases or delay upgrades. So that revenue stream isn’t exactly recurring, it’s largely transactional.” Apple has not yet signaled weakness. In April, it said demand remained high and suggested that it had not seen signs of deteriorating consumer confidence",error,513
521,". The bigger problem was producing enough supply to meet demand for its products. But the smartphone and laptop markets are showing some signs of slowing. The high-end part of the smartphone market, where Apple sells, is holding up better than the bargain bin, although overall phone sales have started to slide. Micron Technology, a supplier of memory for Apple devices, warned on Thursday that it expected both smartphone sales and PC sales to be significantly lower than previously estimated because of weakening consumer demand, partially caused by rising inflation around the world. Unit shipments of so-called premium devices that cost $400 or more declined 8% in the first quarter, compared to 10% for the overall market, according to recent estimates from Counterpoint Research. Apple can afford some additional costs. Its sales have been growing for the past two years, and it maintains a healthy margin that’s the envy of its hardware competitors. But Apple may not have to eat those higher costs at all. Customers tend to have significant disposable income, compared to buyers of Android devices, who tend to choose based on price. In the “ultra-premium market,” or phones that cost over $1,000, Apple took 66% of unit shipments during the first quarter, according to Counterpoint. “With global inflation rising, the entry-level and lower price band segments are likely to be harder hit,” Counterpoint researchers wrote. A Morgan Stanley survey from June said 70% of U.S. consumers were were planning to cut back on spending over the next six months because of inflation. But wealthy households — Apple’s customers — were more positive about their finances and the trajectory of the economy. “Households with an income of $150K+ are more resilient; the highest uptick in plans to cut back is observed among the mid-tier income cohort,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Over the last five years, Apple has raised prices for its iPhones several times. In 2017, Apple introduced a high-end $1,000 iPhone model, which drew a substantial proportion of customers who were willing to pay up for a more powerful device. More recently, Apple quietly raised prices in 2020 when it increased the starting price of the mainline, best-selling model — at the time the iPhone 12 — from $699 to $799. Reuters noted on Friday that Apple has lifted the price of its flagship phone in Japan by nearly a fifth, with the entry level iPhone 13 now costing the equivalent of $870.

Futurum CEO names 3 he’s bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst’s best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks ‘alpha’ opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple’s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers. “Automakers around the world are excited to bring this new version of CarPlay to customers,” Schubert added before displaying a slide with 14 carmaker brands, including Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Industry observers believe carmakers need to embrace software services — and look at Apple’s offering with skepticism — or risk getting left behind. “It’s a really difficult time in the industry, where the car companies think they’re still building cars. They’re not. They’re building software on wheels, and they don’t know it, and they’re trading it away,” said Conrad Layson, senior analyst at AutoForecast Solutions. The new version of CarPlay could be a huge emerging revenue engine for Apple. First, if a user loves the iPhone’s CarPlay interface, then they’re less likely to switch to an Android phone. That’s a strategic priority for Apple, which generates the majority of its revenue through hardware sales. Second, while the company doesn’t yet charge a fee to automakers or suppliers, it could sell services for vehicles the same way it distributes iPhone software. In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car’s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters. Apple already generates tens of billions from the App Store, and stands to boost that if it ever decides to charge for services in cars. In 2021, for example, Apple grossed between $70 billion and $85 billion in total sales from its App Store — of which it takes between 15% and 30%, depending on the app. Apple doesn’t currently take a percentage of purchases made on iPhone apps for physical goods or services. The new CarPlay also allows Apple to collect high-level knowledge and data about how people use their vehicles. That’s valuable information if it ever ends up releasing its own car",error,513
523,", which has been under highly secretive development for years. (Apple’s car group and its CarPlay team are organized in separate divisions.) For example, when people use Apple’s Maps app, the company gains insight into which routes are most popular and when traffic is highest. It’s also in a position to see which CarPlay apps are gaining traction and downloads. In a note earlier this year, Morgan Stanley analysts surmised advances in self-driving could free up trillions of hours per year that Apple could address with new services and products — a potentially enormous market. “What’s an hour of human time worth in a car with nothing to do? Depends who you ask... but (and this is just our view) 1.2 trillion hours times anything is A VERY LARGE NUMBER,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote earlier this year. Apple says heavy hitters like Honda, Nissan and Renault are “excited” to support the new CarPlay. The 14 brands represented on Apple’s slide delivered more than 17 million vehicles in 2021. But car companies might not be as excited as Apple suggested. Few of them have announced models that will support the new CarPlay and most are noncommittal. Land Rover, which appeared on Apple’s slide, is “working with Apple” to see how it could be “part of” its infotainment system, a spokesperson said. “It is too early to comment on future product offerings,” the Land Rover and Jaguar spokesperson added. Mercedes-Benz described its commitment to CarPlay as “discussions” with Apple. “In general, we evaluate all potentially relevant new technologies and functions internally,” a Mercedes Benz spokesperson said. The lack of commitment from automakers may be a timing and product cycle issue: Apple says that vehicles will start to be announced “late next year.” But the cool reaction could also be because the new CarPlay represents a major shift in Apple’s relationship with cars. The new CarPlay will require the car’s real-time systems to pass that information back to the user’s iPhone, where it will be analyzed and integrated into Apple’s own software and rendered on the car’s screens. Apple’s interface will also include vehicle controls. Users can tap an Apple-designed touch-screen button to turn up the air conditioning, according to Apple’s promotional video. “",error,513
524," improving supply and believe Apple’s $4 billion to $8 billion supply headwind commentary for the June quarter was more likely at the lower end of this range,” Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley wrote in a note this month. Apple has grappled with shutdowns in urban China, including in Shanghai. Covid restrictions could have hurt Apple’s iPhone sales in China early in the quarter, but could have lifted sales in June as people left lockdown ready to spend. Analysts polled by FactSet predict that Apple’s Greater China sales will be around $13.79 billion, which would be a decline from the $14.56 billion in sales from a year ago. Investors will also be listening closely to see if Apple is signaling consumer weakness in any regions around the world. “We believe outlook/demand commentary will be the key focus as we try to gauge the impact to Apple’s earnings in the event of a slowing consumer/macro environment,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note. Smartphone and PC sales have been slowing, but Apple has been less affected because the high-end market, where it sells, has been more resilient. TSMC, Apple’s main supplier of processors, warned demand for PCs, smartphones, and consumer electronics is trending weaker. What’s more, if Apple signals that demand is slowing, it would be another signal of a potential recession. Goldman Sachs’ Rod Hall notes that “high-end demand may be beginning to weaken in Europe driven by high inflation and falling consumer confidence.” Apple has not announced a slowdown in hiring or other cost controls, unlike Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta. But Apple is quietly slowing its pace of hiring, according to Bloomberg News, and some analysts believe that company management could talk about its strategy to control expenses. The tech giant hasn’t provided guidance since the start of the pandemic, citing uncertainty, and some expect this trend to continue. “While we don’t expect Apple to guide F4Q22, the company is likely to provide qualitative commentary as it has done for several quarters,” Rakers wrote. Overall, analysts are still confident in Apple being an efficient company with a strong cash balance, loyal customers and competitive products.

It can even split into two separate cutouts, so you can see a timer on one side and track the arrival time of your Lyft simultaneously, for example. There’s also a new always-on display. This allows you to glance over at your lock screen on your phone while it’s sitting on your desk and see dim but useful information. That’s something Samsung, Google and other Android phone makers have been including for years, but Apple’s approach is different. It lights up the whole screen instead of just tiny sections. It’s neat, but I turned it off because I try not to look at my phone all the time, especially when someone is talking to me. This is a personal preference, and I understand why some people may find it useful. If you put your iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max face down on a table, or in your pocket, the always-on display is deactivated. The only time I really liked using the always-on display was when I was watching “House of the Dragon” on HBO Max and needed to access my Apple TV remote. Instead of having to open the Apple Remote every time I needed to pause, the always-on display meant the remote stayed on my iPhone screen. It was as if the actual remote, which I always seem to lose, was right next to me. The front and back cameras are better than the iPhone 13 Pro. Apple improved its low-light performance by 2x thanks to the new Photonic Engine and improved camera sensors, making photos taken at night sharper. The 48-megapixel camera captures great detail. Take a look at the scenic picture I captured while visiting New York City’s Little Island public park last weekend. Apple also unveiled an action mode that allows you to shoot smooth videos. I often use a gimbal to capture video, but action mode has eliminated that need by stabilizing the picture for me. It means you should be able to run around filming your kids without the video looking bumpy. The battery life on the 14 Pro Max is a noticeable improvement. Apple boasts that both the 14 Pro and Pro Max have all-day battery life and I was able to go about my day streaming audio, watching YouTube videos, scrolling through social media, making calls, and sending texts. On a full charge, I",error,513

I didn’t really notice this in daily usage, but professionals who record lots of videos should notice faster rendering times. It also futureproofs the phone so that when more powerful games and apps come out, the operating system will be able to keep up. Apple debuted new safety features such as car crash detection and satellite connectivity. I wasn’t able to test out car crash detection, for obvious reasons. Satellite connectivity sounds promising – it will allow you to connect to emergency services when you don’t have WiFi or cell service – but Apple won’t release the feature until November. All of the iPhone 14s still have a Lightning port instead of USB-C. I wasn’t expecting Apple to switch, but it would be really useful to just carry the same USB-C charger that I use to power a MacBook and an iPad. The 14 Pro Max is a bit bulkier and heavier than the iPhone 13 Pro Max. If you don’t often have pockets and prefer not to carry around such a large screen, you may want to opt for the 14 Pro which has a smaller display than the Pro Max. The iPhone 14 Pro, which starts at $999, is effectively the same phone as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, with slightly less battery life and a smaller 6.1-inch screen. You still get the great display, and the cameras are the same. Then there’s the regular iPhone 14, which is a small update over last year’s iPhone 13. It starts at $799 and has upgraded cameras over the iPhone 13, slightly improved graphics processing and the same car-crash and satellite SOS features in the iPhone 14 Pro. But, it’s missing the following features that you can get in the Pro: There’s one more member of the lineup this year. The iPhone 14 Plus has the same features as the regular iPhone 14, but the screen size of the Pro Max, and starts at $899. It seems compelling for people who want a bigger screen without shelling out the $1,099, but it won’t be released until Oct. 7, so I haven’t had the chance to review it yet.

The second-generation Apple Watch SE comes only in aluminum in either 44mm or 40mm, and it doesn’t have the always-on display. It’s available in black, tan and silver. While the aluminum is slightly cheaper looking, you can feel a little better knowing the production process Apple is now using for the 2022 SE reduces carbon emissions by over 80%. I appreciate the size of the SE. The Apple Watch 8 felt a bit clunky while I was using it, which is a complaint I’ve heard from my other female friends. I also found that because the SE is lighter in weight, it was more comfortable to use for sleep tracking. Despite being the cheaper model, the SE has the latest S8 processor, which is the same one that’s inside the new Series 8. Apple says the upgrade makes the SE 20% faster than the first generation SE, which debuted in 2020. The Series 8 does have the U1 chip as well, which the SE does not. This chip allows you to use location tracking in the Find My app. Both watches felt like they worked at the same speed to me. It was just as easy to navigate on either watch between the workout app, mindfulness and the weather app with no glitches. The SE has heart rate and fall detection, while the Series 8 can measure blood oxygen levels and has an ECG app to monitor heart rhythms. The Series 8 does have a new temperature sensor that enables menstrual cycle tracking with retrospective ovulation estimates. While I appreciate Apple incorporating women’s health into the new watch, I have a hard time understanding how retrospective ovulation will provide the data necessary for women who are trying to conceive. Instead of giving you data about when you ovulated last month, other wearables such as Ava Fertility tell you when you’re actively ovulating so you can take advantage of your fertility window if you are trying to conceive. Heart rate notifications on the new SE can alert users of unusually high or low heart rates or irregular rhythms which Apple says has helped save lives. There is one advancement in the Series 8 that could provide users with important information. It now has AFib monitoring, which will help diagnose people with atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat. When it comes to sleep, both watches provide comprehensive sleep tracking, though as I mentioned,",error,513

Apple employees were required to begin to return to the office this spring after nearly two years of working mainly from home during the Covid pandemic. Holding WWDC in-person this month sets the stage for a fall launch where Apple will show new phones, and maybe even a high-end mixed-reality headset, in front of a live crowd to get immediate hands-on feedback from the press and partners. Just like the old days. Apple sometimes reveals new hardware at WWDC, but the products are usually pricey, high-powered and aimed at programmers — usually Macs, which are required to build apps for the iPhone. The last time Apple announced hardware products at WWDC was in 2019 when it released the $6,000 Mac Pro and a $5,000 monitor. Before that, it announced updates to Mac desktops and laptops in 2017. Apple could reveal the successor to the M1 processor at WWDC. It teased at a product release event earlier that a high-end model called the Mac Pro with an Apple-designed chip was forthcoming. The “M2,” as it could be called, would be the next-generation Mac processor and could come in a redesigned MacBook Air, according to Bloomberg. At the very least, discussing the advances in Apple’s processors would be a good fit for the developer-centric conference. Apple originally announced its switch to its own processors at WWDC in 2020. Apple’s next big product category, augmented or mixed reality hardware, is unlikely to make an appearance. Apple might talk about new apps and software that lay the groundwork for a mixed reality headset or pair of augmented reality glasses, and it often announces updates to its augmented reality development software, ARKit, at WWDC. (Augmented reality displays computer-generated images on top of transparent lenses that let users view the real world, while mixed reality is a fully immersive experience like virtual reality, but with external cameras showing images of the real world outside.) But new product categories usually get their own launch events rather than being shoehorned into WWDC, and the headset reportedly hasn’t entered into mass production yet. Major software updates are a better bet. In previous years, Apple has announced the new version of its iOS software at WWDC in June, released a public beta version for early adopters and testers later in the month, and then released the final version of the software alongside new",error,513

Apple’s iMessage is slightly different from other messaging services because it is the default text messaging app on the iPhone. Apple’s systems detect when an iPhone texts another iPhone and, instead of sending that message through the SMS system, it uses Apple’s own proprietary iMessage network. Users see the text they sent as a “blue bubble,” as opposed to the green color seen on SMS texts, like those to Android users. The inferiority of “green bubble” texts has become a meme and inspired a song by the musician Drake. iMessage chats provide a better user experience than SMS chats on an iPhone. Many of Apple’s features, like adding emoji reactions to a single text message, barely work on SMS chats. iMessage chats feel faster because of Apple’s animations and include features like bubbles that indicate whether a user is typing, and superior group chat administration. Apple continues to distinguish iMessage from SMS through new features, like the ability to unsend or edit messages, which will be released this fall. Google says that it doesn’t want Apple to bring iMessage to Android, but that it wants Apple to support RCS, which was developed by a group of wireless carriers and other tech companies to be an improvement to the SMS and MMS systems that have been in place for decades. Google’s campaign on Tuesday emphasizes that RCS support for iPhones would allow several new features when an iPhone user texts an Android user, including higher-resolution photos, the ability to send texts over Wi-Fi, and the ability to display read receipts. Google also says that RCS messages are encrypted while SMS messages are not, meaning that the new standard is more private. “If [Apple] adopted the platform, it allows consumers to enjoy things like high-res photos and video sharing, read receipts, rich reactions,” Lofton said. “And this is an important one — better security and privacy with encryption.” But SMS",error,513

The new iPad is powered by the slightly older A14 Bionic chip, but it offers faster performance and longer-lasting battery life compared to the cheaper iPad. It has sharper front and back cameras. And, if you need it, you can also buy a 5G cellular version. But here’s a drawback you should know about: The new iPad only works with the older Apple Pencil. And that only charges and pairs through the old Lightning port. So, you need to buy a $9 dongle if you want to charge that pencil with the new iPad. It’s silly that Apple didn’t add support for the newer second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges and pairs through magnets on the side of other iPads. It doesn’t hurt that it’s also available in some fun colors. Yellow iPad, anyone? The sixth-generation iPad mini, which starts at $499, was released in September 2021. If you value portability, this is the pick for you. This is a great iPad for kids given that has a smaller 8.3-inch screen and weighs just over half a pound. I’ve even seen doctors use it since it fits perfectly in a white coat pocket. Like the new iPad, the mini has a 12-megapixel wide camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide front camera, which work with Center Stage to keep you in focus during video calls. Apple also sells a 5G cellular version of the iPad mini, which means you can download apps, music and movies if you don’t have a Wi-Fi connection. And it has a faster chip than the new entry-level iPad above. The iPad mini works with the $129 second-generation Apple Pencil, which is more comfortable to use than the dated first-generation version. And it’s convenient to charge. You just stick it to the magnet on the side of the iPad. The latest iPad Air, which starts at $599, debuted in March 2022 with Apple’s M1 chip, which is a big upgrade from the A14 or A15 chips found in the other iPads.

The iPad Air has Center Stage, which helps keep you in the frame during video calls, meaning you can move back and forth around the room while chatting on FaceTime and the camera will follow you. You can buy a 5G cellular version of the iPad Air, which means you can download apps, music and movies faster when you’re away from Wi-Fi networks. Like the iPad Pro and iPad mini, the iPad Air works with the 2nd generation Apple Pencil, which is more comfortable to use and charges when it’s attached to magnets on the side of the tablet. The new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros are the highest-end iPads available, with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro offering a brighter and more colorful screen than the 11-inch version. The new models — updated with Apple’s M2 processor and more — are currently available to order online and will be in stores on Oct. 26. This is the iPad for serious gamers, video editors, photographers, designers (or creatives in general) and anyone who just wants the best iPad on the market. The bigger screen on the 12.9-inch iPad might make it attractive for people who prefer using a tablet instead of a laptop. The M2 chip is the biggest update with the new iPad Pros. It’s the same processor that was introduced in the MacBook Air earlier this year. Apple said M2 offers about a 15% speed boost over the M1 processor used in last year’s iPad Pro. That might be beneficial for people trying to eke out as much speed as possible while rendering videos. There are some other upgrades, too. Both new iPad Pro models support Apple’s new hover feature. With hover, the screen can now detect the tip of the Apple Pencil up to 12 millimeters above the surface of the screen. Apple says this will allow artists to sketch with more precision and makes handwriting-to-text conversions faster. The iPad Pro works with the $129 second-generation Apple Pencil. The 11-inch version starts at $799 with Wi-Fi, while the 5G cellular model starts at $999. The 12.9-inch model starts at $1,099 with Wi-Fi and the 5G cellular version starts at $1,299.

While watching HBO’s “House of the Dragon” on my TV at home, I often have to go into a dark room to see everything because the show is shot in dark locations and it’s often hard to see if there’s too much light reflecting on the screen. When I watched the show on the new iPad Pro, however, I noticed it was much easier to see the details on the screen, even when I was in a bright room. The large screen also makes it easier to multitask on the iPad Pro. I liked reading the news while keeping YouTube TV open at the same time. The Apple Pencil Hover experience is useful if you’re using your iPad to draw. Let’s say you want to mix colors. In the picture below, you can see a demo where I’m hovering red paint over a blue circle. The iPad Hover mode shows what the purple color will look like before I tap my Apple Pencil on the screen. The speakers are clear and loud and better than on any other iPad I’ve used. I tried streaming music from the Pro in the bathroom while blow-drying my hair and I could easily make out a song’s lyrics. The iPad Pro’s camera is excellent, but it’s also not an upgrade from last year’s model. The iPad Pros’ two major improvements are the M2 chip and the Apple Pencil experience. New iPad models often get camera upgrades, or an increase in the screen’s brightness, but this year’s models didn’t. This year’s entry-level iPad has a new placement of the front-facing camera.

I’m not sure why Apple didn’t choose to do the same thing on this year’s iPad Pro.

He added that the company’s high-end phones, the iPhone 14 Pro, were supply constrained. “We clearly countered the industry trends on the phone if you look at third party estimates of what the smartphone industry did,” Cook said.   Cook said that supply issues didn’t significantly affect Apple during the period, after several quarters in which supply shortages hurt Apple’s sales. Cook told CNBC said it was paying less for some memory chips.  Apple’s services business also missed estimates.  Apple’s services business reported just under 5% growth during the quarter, a significant slowdown for the investor-favorite and profitable business line versus last quarter, which was 12%.   For the fiscal year, Apple services grew just over 14% to $78.13 billion, a slower rate of growth than 2021′s 16% annual increase, and much slower than 2020′s 27% services growth.   The business includes several different lines, including Apple’s online services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, revenue from the App Store, hardware warranties, and search deals with companies like Google. Apple said it had 900 million total subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to apps through Apple’s App Store.  Apple recently increased prices for Apple Music and Apple TV+, but the increases started during the December quarter.  Cook said the price increases were “disconnected” from Apple’s services performance.   “Well, if you look at the price increases as an example, Music, the licensing cost has increased,” Cook said.  He added that Apple TV+ has more shows now, so Apple feels that the product is more valuable.   Investors generally like Apple’s move into services because the products are more profitable than Apple’s hardware and often bring in recurring revenue.   There were a few bright spots in Apple’s report. Mac sales were up over 25% to $11.51 billion, even as data points from parts suppliers, chipmakers, and competing PC firms were pointing during the quarter to a significant slowdown in laptop and desktop sales after two boom years during the pandemic.   Apple’s Other Products category, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, also saw an annual increase and beat Wall Street",error,513
564," why growth in the services segment is such a huge factor for earnings growth over time. The recurring nature of sales also supports the valuation multiple placed on those earnings. On the conference call with investors, management said Apple now has more than 900 million paid subscriptions across its services, an increase of 155 million from the year ago period and double the level from three years ago. In the products segment, device sales were as follows: Sales of Mac computers hit all-time record, thanks to the launch of the new M2 equipped MacBook Air and MacBook Pro devices, the fulfillment of pent-up demand that from the prior quarter and an easing of supply chain bottlenecks. Sales of wearables, home and accessories hit a September quarter record. The company’s slight revenue miss on iPhones appears to be a supply — not demand — issue. That’s important because as we saw this quarter with the Mac, sales missed due to supply constraints can often be made up in the following quarter. Management said supplies FOR? the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have been constrained since launch and remain so today. Management stressed the iPhone is a hit, citing a 98% customer satisfaction score. Apple also makes three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the UK, the top three in urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany, and the top two in Japan, according to Apple. Perhaps most important, from a long-term perspective, is Apple’s record installed users. We place more weight on the growing installed base than we do device sales in any single quarter, because the greater the installed base, the greater the opportunity to monetize the used base via services and other devices within the Apple ecosystem. As has been the case since the start of the Covid pandemic, management refrained from providing quantitative guidance, instead opting to provide some “directional insights” based on an assumption that Covid-related impacts do not worsen. On sales, management expects annual revenue growth to decelerate in the December quarter versus the September quarter due to a 10% headwind from foreign exchange, a tough Mac comp as we lap the M1 launch and a slowdown in advertising and gaming in its services division. The Street was looking for 3.4% revenue growth in the December quarter coming into the print so a deceleration from the 8% rate we saw in the reported quarter is in line with expectations. Additionally, December quarter gross margin was guided to be in",error,513

Like the Series 8, the Ultra has a new temperature sensor that enables menstrual cycle tracking with retrospective ovulation estimates. But Apple recommends you wear the Ultra to bed for best results, and since I find it too uncomfortable to wear to sleep, this was a no-go for me. Aside from the larger battery, I really appreciate the larger speaker on the Ultra. The watch has two speakers that work together, which makes the Ultra 40% louder than the Series 8, according to Apple. I often use my watch to pick up phone calls, especially while I’m cooking. I could hear the difference when using the Ultra compared with my Series 7. While this feature is really meant to be louder in extreme conditions for the outdoorsy type, I appreciated it for regular use, too. The Ultra has a ton of features that are designed to keep adventurers safe. It has a more precise GPS, works in extreme temperature and has better water resistance. While I’m not a hiker, I used one of these features to find my way back home from a walk. Back track is a new GPS-enabled setting that allows hikers to retrace their steps. If you’re off the grid, the function starts working automatically. I can see how valuable this would be for someone who doesn’t have GPS or cellular and is lost in some remote area. There’s a new action button on the Ultra, which you can customize to serve several possible functions. I use it to create compass waypoints, which means it drops a pin if I’ve been somewhere I want to remember. The intended use for this is for hikers who see an awesome waterfall and want to remember its location. I’d be more likely to use it to mark a restaurant I’ve walked past so I can look it up later. The Ultra also has an emergency siren, which Apple says can be heard up to 600 feet away. When the Ultra is in night mode, you can also see the screen in pitch black, as I tried to demonstrate in the picture below. This feature can be used only when you’ve downloaded the Wayfinder watch face, but it provides you with the most vital information in the dark, such as your compass location, which is more accurate than ever.

I was initially afraid this would be too sensitive, but after a few weeks of use, I’m happy to report I’ve never accidentally activated this feature. I often fall asleep with my AirPods in, so I was impressed that the volume controls weren’t activated when I was tossing and turning. The new AirPods also come with a new MagSafe charging case. You can even use your Apple Watch charger for the new Pros, which is very convenient. Aside from easier charging, the battery life on the new AirPods is noticeably better. Overall, Apple says battery life has improved by 33%. You now get up to 30 hours of total listening time while active noise cancellation is on. That’s up six hours from the previous generation. If you’ve read my prior reviews, you may have noticed a common theme: I lose things a lot. There’s a built-in speaker in the new AirPods Pro that plays a sound so you can locate your lost AirPods. The new AirPods case also comes with a new U1 chip, so you can use the Find My app to see the exact location of where you last left your AirPods. There’s a lanyard loop on the side of the case that allows you to attach your AirPods to your wrist or a handbag. I haven’t tried out a lanyard yet since they’re sold separately by third parties, but I can see how this would help me keep up with them. The new AirPods Pro have superior audio for a few reasons. First, there’s a new extra small ear tip, so hopefully people who say AirPods fall out of their ears or who don’t get a good seal will see this as a solution. There’s also a new feature called personalized spatial audio. By using your phone’s front-facing camera, your iPhone remembers the size of your ears and helps ensure the sounds you’re hearing are tailored to your individual ear size. In Apple Music there are songs that are specifically designed for spatial audio, and you can really hear the difference. When you’re in your AirPods settings, you can even play a sound by navigating to the tab under Spatial Audio that says See & Hear How It Works. You can see",error,513

Lawmakers also met with experts from Stanford University, including those from the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, according to center founding member Steve Blank. In a phone call following the discussion Thursday, Blank said he communicated the need for a defense strategy that involves more public-private partnerships across different industries to get the U.S. up to speed with China. Blank said he was impressed by the bipartisanship and interest he saw from lawmakers in attendance. “In general, the questions they asked, you would have been very proud to be an American sitting in that room,” Blank said. “They were bipartisan, and they were to the point and they were very smart. These people understand the issues, and they’re trying to help the country be better.” Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a committee member who represents Silicon Valley, told CNBC in a phone interview ahead of the trip on Tuesday that he was excited for his colleagues to visit his home district. Khanna said it’s always valuable for lawmakers to spend time learning about cutting-edge technologies such as AI, quantum computing and climate tech to better understand how to both regulate and foster it. “I think it would be wise for every member of Congress to spend a week in Silicon Valley,” Khanna said. “Technology is going to define so many fields from the economy to national security to our issues of citizenship, and we need people to be immersed in it, at least understanding it.” Khanna and others have described the purpose of the trip as primarily a fact-finding mission. While the conversations will likely inform future policymaking and hearings, lawmakers entered the meetings aiming to learn from industry executives on the ground. The group was also slated to meet with venture capitalists on Thursday, including Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and SV Angel. Khanna expected the VCs would discuss how the government could “better collaborate with the private sector” to stay ahead of China in key areas of emerging technology. On Friday, lawmakers were set to discuss cryptocurrency with experts at Stanford before traveling to Cupertino to meet with Cook at Apple’s headquarters, according to the source familiar with the committee’s plans.

612," received should be clear-cut, there are also more nuanced cases where customers complain that an event like a music festival didn’t live up to its billing. In online credit-card forums, several users complained that Goldman initially refused to side with them even though they provided evidence of fraud. “Goldman Sachs is holding me responsible for a $930 charge that was made at an Apple store with Apple Pay that I did not make,” according to one Reddit post. “Until now, I’ve never experienced less professional service from a major company, and this has been a complete nightmare.” While the bank had automated ways for customers to log disputes through their iPhones, it had done less work on streamlining the resolution of such cases, according to the people. The bank hadn’t initially accounted for what insiders deemed “edge cases,” or situations that break from the norm among the vast majority of transactions, they said. “We were making the case that we have a seamless way to dispute transactions,” the source said. “But we got no credit for the front end, and we had some failures on the back end.” Another part of the puzzle is that Goldman relied on three outside vendors to help service Apple Card customers. Known as business process organizations, or BPOs, the sector often struggles with high worker turnover, increasing the odds that a representative is new or not fully trained. In February, Apple sent some card users notice giving them a chance to resubmit old disputes, according to industry publication 9to5Mac. The email acknowledged that Apple had “identified that some customer-initiated disputes may not have been resolved correctly,” according to the report. There are also plenty of customers on Reddit who say they’ve had good experiences with the Apple Card. The product won an award from J.D. Power for customer satisfaction last year. The people with knowledge of the matter referred to the bank’s issues as the growing pains of a new business that saw an unprecedented surge in customers. Apple Card users doubled to 6.4 million by May 2021 from a year earlier, according to Cornerstone Advisors. Outstanding loans by Goldman nearly doubled last year, according to the Nilson Report. Goldman is still a relative newcomer to the U.S. credit card industry, and the Apple Card represented its biggest step yet into the financial lives of ordinary Americans.

And they need powerful processing capabilities and software to reduce latency so that what the user sees inside the headset isn’t delayed or blurred. This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he’s bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst’s best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks ‘alpha’ opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside Most important is the high-resolution screen that needs to be much denser than a smartphone display because it’s so close to the user’s eyes. Smartphone screens average about 550 pixels per inch, but mixed reality devices require displays with about 3,500 PPI, according to CounterPoint Research. While Meta and Apple haven’t released their headsets, a few devices currently on the market support passthrough mixed reality. The experiences tend to be limited — black and white or low-quality video — because of a lack of processing power. A few weeks ago, I was able to test a headset from Varjo, a Finnish company co-founded by Urho Konttori, a former Microsoft and Nokia executive. Last year, Varjo released the XR-3, which offers full-color, low-latency passthrough mixed reality. It’s expensive, heavy, and aimed at businesses. It costs $6,495 to purchase or about $1,500 to rent it for a year. In playing around with the XR-3, I felt less isolated than with other VR headsets. I could access a virtual world with the press of a single button, and I could pull up games that took over my entire field of view. I could use virtual computer monitors displaying Windows applications inside the virtual world. I was also able to interact with the world around me through Varjo’s passthrough view. In the demo, Varjo placed a life-size car model inside the space. I was able to walk around it and inspect its interior and discuss what I was seeing with someone who wasn’t wearing a VR headset. Most impressively, when passthrough was turned on, I could interact with the actual environment around me, carrying on a conversation with the person next to me or finding a chair and sitting in it. This isn’t possible with existing VR technology, which forces you to remove",error,513
614," yourself from the physical world. Konttori told me that was one of his main goals. The company wants to almost mimic “human-eye” display quality, which he calls the “holy grail” of mixed reality. The XR-3 has two 2880 by 2720 pixel displays, and the company uses eye tracking to focus its processing power to deliver better image quality where your eyes are looking. The key is “being able to merge the physical reality around you with the virtual reality objects and make it into a single coherent scene, where you cannot tell apart what is real and what is virtual anymore,” Konttori said. “Part of this evolution is that you can see that at some point, the fidelity of this experience is equal to what you would perceive by looking at it with just your own eyes.” However, to use the XR-3 you have to be tethered by a cable to a powerful gaming PC. Meta and Apple are focused on developing devices that don’t require attachment to a separate computer. Konttori knows it will be hard for his startup to compete with some of the biggest tech companies in the world, but he says Meta and Apple still face challenges. That’s because developing a consumer-friendly product with the right weight and power consumption is very tricky, especially when it comes to keeping costs down and shipping millions of them. “Companies are focusing on consumer-alike experiences, which means that they are still really driven by the size, weight, ergonomics point of view, as well as cost,” Konttori said. Apple is notoriously secretive about its product roadmap, especially when it comes to new categories. The company has invested heavily in virtual reality research and development in its Technology Development Group and has purchased several startups specializing in mixed reality technology. According to reports from Bloomberg and The Information, Apple is developing a mixed reality headset that resembles ski goggles with a powerful homegrown chip, similar to what powers its MacBook laptops, and higher-resolution displays than what’s currently on the market. The headset will reportedly support passthrough video and offer games and other applications. At one point, Apple was aiming for at least resolution similar to a 4K TV per eye for its first headset, because anything less could result in users seeing individual pixels, The Information reported. Apple hasn’t confirmed its plans to release a mixed reality headset, and the company didn’t respond to",error,513
627," hub is a stated policy objective of government of India,” says Amitendu Palit, an economist specializing in international trade and investment at the National University of Singapore. “Global developments that have created a shift away from China in some major markets, such as smartphone and semiconductors, are clearly areas where India expects to benefit by bringing in major segments of supply chains.” India’s dream of becoming the new factory of the world will have to overcome longstanding hurdles. A formidable bureaucracy, lagging infrastructure and labyrinthine red tape have forced many foreign businesses to either shun India or shutter their local operations. A lack of skilled labor and innovation, poor production quality, and a reluctance to adopt rapidly evolving technology are also seen as hindrances. Invest India representatives declined to comment. In a recent interview with local Indian media, Brendan Nelson, president of Boeing International, said India was a key part of aircraft maker’s supply chain ecosystem and that the company planned to significantly expand its Indian footprint. Boeing currently has 5,000 employees and 300 suppliers in its supply chain in India. These numbers could rise meaningfully as its supplier base in India broadens, providing additional support for Boeing’s international supply chain. “These suppliers are an integral part of our global supply base and are manufacturing and exporting systems and components for some of Boeing’s most advanced products from India to the world,” wrote Schulte. At the recently concluded Aero India 2023, Boeing announced investments in setting up the Global Support Center and Logistics Center in India, which will also help support Boeing’s customers locally more quickly and efficiently. Boeing has had a long standing partnership with Air India and the Tata Group. The two operate a joint venture in India called Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL), which is closely aligned with India’s push for self reliance, co-developing integrated systems in aerospace and defense for India and other nations. The company’s Hyderabad-based manufacturing facility recently rolled out the first batch of complex vertical fin structures for the 737 family of airplanes. The vertical fins have been made by Xi’an Aircraft Industry in China. The partners have their internal issues to work through. Boeing, from the 737 Max to the Dreamliner, has run into inventory issues and production delays, which resulted in a surprise loss in its most recent quarter. Debt-laden Air India is in the middle of an ambitious turnaround plan under its new owner, TATA Group, the Indian conglomerate that",error,513
627," regained ownership of the government-owned national carrier in 2021. That’s on top of the hurdles foreign companies can expect to face in India’s accleration as a manufacturing and supply chain partner. Apple may be on the way to 25% of iPhones made in India, from about 5%-7% Apple products currently, though not without growing pains. A recent FT report claimed Apple is running into issues with its first foray into India-based manufacturing with poor quality of products.  “Aligning domestic standards with global quality benchmarks is an ongoing process,” said Palit, who argues that the process will improve as more multinational organizations bring in their global vendors to India, “similar to the way they did for automobiles.” “India will take two to three years to learn the ropes in these advanced fields, but they will get there,” says Vivek Wadhwa, a Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur and academic, who recently returned from a trip to India where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ratan Tata, CEO of Tata Group. The advantages that China has built over the years in scale and speed of production will be difficult for India to reproduce any time soon. China also benefits from regional support that India can’t recreate. “A neighborhood” of industrially complementary and capable countries including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, is a notable advantage, Palit said. For India, “its neighboring South Asian region remains industrially underdeveloped, except for some sectors such as garments,” he said. Regional industrial growth could be critical for realizing India’s aspirations to grow into a global manufacturing hub, and India’s potential is undeniable. The International Monetary Fund’s forecast for India’s GDP growth stands at 6.1%, far outpacing China’s 4.4% rise, in 2023. Further, India is projected to leapfrog Germany and Japan to become the world’s third-largest economy over the next decade, and become a $10 trillion economy by 2035, per a Centre for Economics and Business Research report.   But to be able to effectively tap the local consumer market, foreign businesses need strong relationships in place through local manufacturing to ultimately benefit on the consumer side. “An essential condition for foreign businesses to succeed in India, particularly manufacturing, is to have capable local partners,” Palit said. “Licensing arrangements can be successfully",error,513
630," Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients. “This is a big deal – suggesting that services (30%+ of gross profits, potentially growing 20%, with expanding margins) + buybacks (3%-4% per year) could drive 10%+ earnings per share growth for Apple, even with Hardware/other products growing at 0%.” Other analysts say their math works out close to the same way. The services business can make Apple profit grow “high single digits with no growth in hardware,” said Angelo Zino of CFRA Research. Add in stock buybacks and the number can easily support double-digit earnings per share growth by reducing the number of outstanding shares over which Apple’s profit is spread. “Margins in services are going to continue to expand,” Zino said. “The story for Apple is that 30% of the company is services and wearables. Young kids and users are growing up now on Apple’s platform. All that people 13 to 34 want is Apple products.”  Migrating the company to services has been among Apple’s top goals for years. Not only does the steadier services business insulate Apple’s earnings growth from the more cyclical manufacturing unit’s swings – a point brought home by the 30% decline in Apple stock in 2015-2016 as iPhone demand in China slowed – it also boosts the company’s stock multiple because software and internet services stocks routinely command high price to earnings multiples. “The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment,” Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said on the earnings conference call with analysts last week. “We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone.”  There is the hard-to-quantify potential of Apple’s businesses for gaming-related wearables, the next big leg of a business that includes Apple’s Watch, AirPods and its Beats headphones, and for autonomous vehicles, which reportedly may not include an Apple-branded vehicle before 2025.

631," Analysts see the correlation. Advertisers that can no longer get the level of targeting they want on Facebook are spending more on Google. “Did Apple iOS changes trigger a market share shift from Facebook to Google?” MKM Partners’ Rohit Kulkarni wrote in a report on Thursday. “Yes, we believe so.” MKM has a buy rating on both stocks. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s operating chief and a former senior executive at Google, said Apple’s changes are most harmful to small and medium-sized businesses, which are most reliant on personalization and targeting in their advertising. “So we’re definitely seeing that this has more of an impact for ‘SMBs,’ ” she said. Zuckerberg has been worried about this possibility for a long time. Without owning the device or operating system, Facebook can’t fully chart its own path, and is always subject to the whims of other companies. About a decade ago, Facebook designed its own phone, but it was a disaster. Here’s what Facebook said in the risk factors of its IPO prospectus in 2012, which was still the early days of mobile for the company. “We are dependent on the interoperability of Facebook with popular mobile-operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade our products’ functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect Facebook usage on mobile devices.” In 2014, Facebook acquired a nascent virtual reality headset company called Oculus for $2 billion, giving the company a shot at making the next generation of hardware and integrating its own software. That acquisition is the foundation for the future that Zuckerberg so much desires. Late last year, he changed Facebook’s name to Meta Platforms. In Thursday’s earnings report, the company said its Reality Labs group, home to the virtual reality development, lost more than $10 billion in 2021. Investors are rightly worried. Facebook’s core business is losing users, and Apple is flexing in a way that’s causing panic. For Zuckerberg, the answer to his real world problems may be the virtual world. As much as anything, he wants to break free of Apple and Google, so his company gets to be the one making the rules. — CNBC’s Kif Leswing and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

I was able to wear the Pixel Buds Pro for hours without feeling even slight ear pain, which sometimes happens when I wear my AirPods Pro. A promise of such comfort would be a welcome on long airplane rides. They boast a longer battery life than the AirPods Pro with seven hours of listening time on one charge when noise-canceling technology is activated. When that technology isn’t activated, they last up to 11 hours. Apple’s AirPods Pro last four and a half hours on a single charge. That’s a big deal for a lot of people and, as an AirPods user, I noticed the difference. The Pixel Buds Pro let you converse easily with someone speaking another language, thanks to a tie-in with Google translate. I tested the real-time conversation mode with my Brazilian stepmom whose first language is Portuguese. To begin, I opened the Google Translate App on my Pixel 6a and tapped “Conversation.” After a few minutes, we were able to carry on a conversation with a near-perfect translation. I asked, “Would your family in Brazil use this translation feature?” To which my stepmom replied in Portuguese, “Yes. Is it affordable? How much does it cost?” The phone translated the conversation for me and I heard her response in English through the Pixel Buds Pro. I probably wouldn’t use the feature to ask someone for directions, unless I was really desperate since it was slightly awkward and time consuming. But it would be useful if I was shopping overseas and needed to ask a question about whatever I was buying. The Pixel Buds Pro come in four colors: black, coral, gray and light green. I like that the ear tips are black instead of white. (I know I’m not the only person who can get grossed out after looking at the earwax buildup on white earbuds.) The Pixel Buds Pro are hypersensitive to touch. The outside surface of the buds responds if you touch it to pause a song, for example.

We’re out there, watching trends, listening to audio trends that are happening, and then finding ways that are super brand-relevant for us to participate in that space,” Myers said. TikTok became the world’s third-largest social network last year, ranking behind Facebook and Instagram, according to Insider Intelligence. It estimates that TikTok will have 755 million monthly users globally in 2022, and its market share will top 20%. While more users are flocking to TikTok, Easter said big tech firms could miss out if they don’t invest in content creation. “Google, for example, would be remiss if they ignored an audience that skews younger,” Easter said. “It’s not like, ‘Hey, I’m Google over here. Please search.’ It’s about making sure that your brand is building and winning hearts and minds, wherever the users are at.” Users on products like Google’s search engine are decreasing. In 2021, TikTok.com was the most popular domain on the internet, outranking Google.com, Facebook.com, Microsoft.com and Apple.com, according to Cloudfare, an internet hosting provider, which also has its own TikTok account. While big tech competes for audiences on TikTok similar to other brands, it’s actually easier for these large companies to rise above the noise. “I think TikTok is a lot easier to execute as a larger brand,” said Haley Filippone, a social and public relations strategist at Nebo Agency. “Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter have the time, money and resources to really commit to the platform, but you’ll see that for smaller brands, video production can be very challenging.

The new laptop runs on Apple’s latest M1 Pro and M1 Max processors, which are even more capable of handling intensive tasks such as video editing multiple high-resolution video files at the same time. It has the best screen ever on an Apple laptop that’s brighter, sharper and smoother than earlier Intel models. But, more notably, the laptops still offer long battery life, thanks to the more power-efficient design of Apple’s processors. Paired with plenty of ports that let you attach high-speed accessories, additional displays or more storage, it’s easily the best laptop on the market. Apple’s fiscal Q1 earnings in January will give an indication of how well all its new computers are selling. But it’s clear the move from Intel has allowed Apple to move full speed ahead with its own chip development, much like it does for iPhones and iPads, the latter of which has yet to be matched by any other tablet on the market. It’s no longer beholden to delays that plagued Intel, which started to lag behind AMD with its new 7nm chips. And Apple has full control over its “stack,” which means it can design new computer hardware and software together, instead of letting the power of another company’s chips dictate what its computers can and can’t do. Take, for example, the way M1 is able to improve the quality of the webcam on its computers, even though it’s the same image sensor used in prior Intel models. There are other benefits to owning the hardware and software. Apple’s new macOS Monterey software will soon let computers running on M1 share a single keyboard and mouse with an iPad, for example, allowing you to seamlessly control multiple devices at the same time. M1 Macs have other exclusive features, such as on-device voice dictation, improved Siri text-to-speech, more detailed Maps and portrait mode in FaceTime, which blurs the background behind you. And while the app selection is still limited, M1 Macs are capable of running some of the same apps that you run on your iPhone and iPad. Expect the trend to continue next year. Reports have suggested we’ll see yet another new MacBook Air, updates to the most powerful iMac Pro and Mac Pro and more in 2022. And we may see M1 in totally",error,513

But now the app is using artificial intelligence to automatically share photos with up to six people based on who’s in the photo — such as kids or family members. That means, for example, you can set it so every time you take a picture of your kid your partner also gets the picture. Apple is also adding AI features that can translate text in photos or videos that the user takes. The coolest AI feature is called Visual Look Up, which can cut out a dog, a person or other subject from a photo and place it into images or other apps as a sticker. Short-term loans in Apple Wallet. Apple’s Wallet app, which holds keys, credit cards and other digital passes, continues to be an area of focus for Apple. Apple wants the Wallet app to replace everything that’s currently in your wallet, including cash and IDs. This year, Apple introduced a buy now, pay later feature called Apple Pay Later. You can use it to make purchases anywhere Apple Pay is accepted and then pay off the balance through four payments over six weeks. Apple Wallet in iOS 16 will also make it easier to share digital car or home keys through messaging. Apple Maps can add multiple stops to a route. Apple Maps is getting an update that will allow you to add different stops to a route. So, if you’re driving somewhere and you’re planning to pick someone up on the way, you can add their house as the first stop on the way to your destination. It means you don’t have to enter one destination into the app and then enter a second one later. This is perfect for planning a summer road trip and essential for people with electric cars who need to find chargers. Separately, next year, Apple will reveal an updated version of its car software, CarPlay, that will take advantage of this Maps update and more closely integrate with the car’s built-in hardware. More ways to control notifications. Building on last year’s Focus mode, Apple will enable users to have entirely different wallpapers or app setups for different times of day, like when the user is at work or asleep. Individual apps including Calendar, Mail and Messages will allow users to customize which notifications and content belong in each Focus mode. “Hey Siri, hang up.” Siri will soon help you hang up a FaceTime or phone call.

Representatives for Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky and Oklahoma didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Along with the digitization of industries from finance to entertainment, there is a push around the world to create more modern digital ID systems. But efforts in countries including Singapore, France, Germany and China are implemented at the national level rather than through private companies, according to Phillip Phan, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. Throughout the contracts, it’s clear who is in the driver’s seat. Apple is asking states to comply with security requirements laid out by the International Organization for Standardization describing mobile driver licenses. Apple said in September it played an active role in the standard’s development. States have to agree to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple,” according to the documents. That includes performing quality testing that the digital IDs work “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements” across various Apple devices. “If requested by Apple, Agency will designate one or more project manager(s) who shall be responsible for responding to Apple’s questions and issues relating to the Program,” the contract states. States have to agree to wide-ranging efforts designed to ensure the adoption of Apple’s digital IDs, including by offering the new feature “proactively” and at no additional cost whenever a citizen gets new or replacement identification cards. States also have to help spur adoption of the new IDs with “key stakeholders in federal and state government” like the Internal Revenue Service, state and local law enforcement, and businesses that restrict users by age who are “critical to the Program achieving a sufficient level of acceptance.” While the state agencies have to “prominently feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” the marketing efforts are “",error,513
707," the pandemic reevaluate what is most important to them. And honestly, it has to go to better pay, livable wage for everybody.” In addition to the pandemic conditions, numerous other factors have collided to create what labor experts call a perfect storm for organizing. The U.S. has seen four decades of stagnant wages. Companies that already had healthy profits before the pandemic made even more money after lockdowns. And there are lots of jobs available without enough applicants to fill them. What’s more, the Biden administration is pro-union. In May, Garza and organizers from Amazon and other companies were invited to the White House to discuss their efforts with Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. “They heard some of our stories of fierce anti-union busting, not only from Starbucks but from Amazon,” Garza said of her visit to the White House. “Secretary Walsh said in particular that Starbucks should just come to the table with its partners and work together to collaborate.” Starbucks criticized the visit and requested its own White House meeting, which hasn’t happened. The union movement at Apple stores is progressing at a slower pace. The first union win among Apple’s 270-plus U.S. stores happened on June 18, when workers in Towson, Maryland, voted 65 to 33 to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. No other stores have held a vote. “Being part of a tech company this big, it’s very easy to be intimidated and come off as ungrateful, which is something that we want to make known: that we are not ungrateful,” said Tyra Reeder, a technical specialist at the Towson Apple store. “We’re doing this because we love our jobs. We’re doing this because we see longevity at Apple.” Three other stores have taken steps to unionize, although one in Atlanta withdrew its election petition in May. That same month, a memo was leaked showing Apple’s anti-union talking points, instructing store managers to tell workers they could lose benefits and career opportunities if they organized.  “Unfortunately, these union-busting campaigns do have an impact and they can scare people,” said Sara Steffens, secretary-treasurer of Communications Workers of America, which has about 700,000 members. “And so in Atlanta, the Apple workers decided not",error,513
707," to try to go for an election right at this moment.” CWA helped organize the Atlanta Apple store, as well as workers at Google. In March, Google Fiber contractors in Kansas City held an NLRB election, becoming the first to officially unionize under what’s known as the Alphabet Workers Union. Nearly 1,000 other Google workers have also signed cards to join the AWU, but because the employees haven’t officially held an NLRB election, their group is known as a minority union. “There’s a lot of research that shows that most Americans want unions,” Steffens said. “They just don’t want to go through this scary union-busting process.” About two-thirds of Americans now say they support unions, the highest approval rating since 1965. Yet actual participation remains at a multi-decade low, hovering at 10.3% of the workforce in 2021, down from 10.8% in 2020 and 20% in 1983, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At its peak in 1954, union membership was close to 35%. Although it’s too soon to know official figures for 2022, the first three quarters of the fiscal year — October 1, 2021 through June 30 — saw a 58% increase in official attempts to unionize and exceeded the total number of election petitions from the year before.  In the months that typically pass between when workers file for an election and when they actually vote, big employers often spend millions of dollars on campaigns to dampen support for the union. Amazon, for example, spent $4.26 million on labor consultants in 2021. Both Apple and Starbucks have retained Littler Mendelson, the largest employer-side labor law firm in the country. That means they have similar talking points, often referring to the union as a third party, hungry for dues. “Many people think, well, I don’t want to be paying $100 a month to a union,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor. “That’s why union representation has steadily declined.” In May, Apple raised the starting pay for retail workers from $20 to $22 an hour, a 45% jump from 2018. Unionized workers are asking for $26 to 28 an hour. “I definitely think this was a tactic to kind of say, ‘Hey guys, here�",error,513
707,"�s $2, please shut up,’” Reeder said. Also in May, Apple’s head of retail and human relations, Deirdre O’Brien, put out a video to retail workers discouraging unionizing. She also visited the Towson store after it filed for a union election. Reeder said she viewed O’Brien’s appearance as a “union-busting tactic or a scare tactic.” “That’s not something that I’ve heard happening at our store ever,” Reeder said. “Somebody of that much stature unannounced, walking through our store after we do something like unionize.” Apple declined to comment on the allegations, and told CNBC in a statement that it offers “very strong compensation and benefits for full-time and part-time employees, including health care, tuition reimbursement, new parental leave, paid family leave, annual stock grants and many other benefits.”  At Starbucks, former CEO Howard Schultz came back to run the coffee chain in April and brought with him a history of union opposition. He spent his early weeks visiting multiple stores for “collaborative sessions” with baristas. Starbucks has said it plans to bargain in good faith. A month after Schultz’s return, Workers United filed more than 250 unfair labor practice charges claiming Starbucks engaged in surveillance, fired workers and closed a store in Ithaca, New York, in retaliation for voting to unionize. Then in June, a federal judge in Arizona ruled in favor of Starbucks after three pro-union workers claimed they were wrongfully dismissed. A Starbucks spokesperson told CNBC via email, “Claims of anti-union activity are categorically false. We respect our partners’ rights to organize and are following NLRB rules to ensure all partners are informed about the process.”  Garza said in June that more than two months after her Starbucks Reserve location voted to unionize, that the mood was still “very tense,” and “a lot of partners still do not feel safe from being terminated, and that goes for myself.” Starbucks is known for providing extensive health care benefits to part-time baristas, including coverage for some expensive treatments like in vitro fertilization that are often not covered at service jobs. In May, Starbucks announced wage raises and increased training, but only for stores that haven’t unionized. Logan, the labor professor, said Starbucks",error,513
707,"’ reputation for being a progressive employer has helped fuel the union movement. “They attract particular kinds of employees who share those progressive values, and often their customers share those progressive values,” he said. “So in a sense, Starbucks has hired exactly the type of employee that’s making the union drive so successful and so dynamic.”  Garza called the company’s behavior “puzzling.” “It’s very surprising that Starbucks is fighting this because the reason that we all joined Starbucks is because of its image as a progressive company,” she said. Google has also been accused of fighting back. The NLRB found that the company “arguably violated” labor law when it fired employees for speaking up. The Google Fiber contractors faced additional anti-union messaging in a letter from the contractor, which said “everyone will be stuck with the union and forced to pay dues.” Google told CNBC in a statement that employees are treated the same regardless of whether they’re in a union. “Our employees have protected labor rights that we support and we’ve long had contracts with both union and non-union vendors,” the company said. Workers in unions make on average 16.6% more than nonunion workers, amounting to almost $200 per week. “If unions weren’t effective for workers, companies wouldn’t fight them so hard,” said Steffans of CWA. “They know that workers will make more money first and foremost when they organize and choose to join a union.” However, there are better ways to get more money, according to Furchtgott-Roth, the former Labor Department economist. “There are so many new jobs out there,” Furchtgott-Roth said. “My message is: There are people who would hire you on a different schedule and probably at a higher rate of pay.” She also said the union model isn’t great for retail because the high turnover rates mean that people who never voted to organize “are going to be having the dues taken out of their paychecks.” But workers are looking at how well their employers are performing and wondering why they’re not getting rewarded equally. For example, Google parent Alphabet recorded its fastest revenue growth rate since 2007 last year. Apple’s margin has been steadily rising and the company closed 2021",error,513

719," app stores for a billion consumers.” Since the trial ended but before the decision was handed down, Apple has made several changes to mollify critics, some as part of settlements with other app developers, including relaxing some rules about emailing customers to encourage them to make off-app purchases and allowing some links in apps. Rogers wrote in the decision that she disagreed with both Apple and Epic Games over the framing of the market Apple allegedly dominates. Rogers found that it was “digital mobile gaming transactions,” not all iPhone apps, as Epic Games had alleged, nor was it all video games, as Apple had claimed. Epic Games is among the most prominent companies to challenge Apple’s control of its iPhone App Store, which has strict rules about what is allowed and not, and requires many software developers to use its in-app payment system, which takes between 15% to 30% of each transaction. Epic’s most popular game is Fortnite, which makes money when players buy V-bucks, or the in-game currency to purchase costumes and other cosmetic changes. Epic wasn’t seeking money from Apple. Instead, it wanted to be allowed to install its own app store on iPhones, which would let it bypass Apple’s cut and impose its own fees on games it distributed. Epic’s Sweeney had chafed against Apple’s in-app purchase rules as early as 2015, according to court filings and exhibits. Friday’s ruling does not allow Epic to offer an app store on Apple’s App Store. But the public clash between the two companies started in earnest in August 2020, when Epic implemented a plan to challenge Apple called “Project Liberty,” according to court filings. Epic Games updated Fortnite on its servers to reduce the price of its in-game currency by 20% if players bought directly from the company, bypassing Apple’s take, and violating Apple’s rules on steering users away from its in-app payments. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store, meaning that new users could not download it and that it would eventually stop working on iPhones because the app could not be updated. As it planned, Epic then filed a lawsuit that culminated in May’s trial. Epic Games will also have to pay Apple damages because it breached its contract, Rogers ruled. The video game developer will pay Apple 30% of all revenue it collected from Fortnite on iPhones and iPads through direct payments. At the",error,513
724," That’s also what Paddle’s CEO thinks will happen. “I think it’s going to be a situation of, if you want to offer an off-platform, in-app purchasing mechanism, you have to offer the Apple in-app purchasing mechanism alongside that as well,” Owens said. Apple hasn’t updated its App Store guidelines, the document that determines what developers can and can’t do in iPhone apps, since the ruling last month. All iPhone apps and updates go through a process called App Review, where Apple employees reject apps that don’t conform to Apple’s rules. The judge’s decision says Apple must allow customers to leave its ecosystem to buy virtual goods on the web. But it doesn’t prevent Apple from making other policy changes to its store, like developing a new way to charge fees for iPhone app transactions that happen off the platform. It’s a possibility that Apple CEO Tim Cook raised in testimony during the trial. “If not for [in-app purchasing], we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess,” Cook said in May. Apple declined to comment but argued during the trial that the App Store ensures user privacy and safety. Apple general counsel Kate Adams said in September that the Epic Games ruling was a “huge win,” and the company hailed the court’s finding that Apple is not a monopoly. Some Wall Street analysts believe the impact on Apple will be limited but real, potentially reducing Apple’s earnings by up to 4%, with off-platform billing being used more often for expensive software subscriptions. Eiting said Apple’s changes might not have a huge financial impact on developers. He argued users will be less likely to complete purchases if they have to go to an external webpage, even if apps can link to it. It could also annoy users, who will have to manage subscriptions individually instead of inside the iPhone’s settings. “I think it’s good to let systems compete, but I’m not convinced it’s going to be a windfall for anyone,” Eiting said. Alternative payment systems will charge developers less than Apple does while still providing convenience, like managing subscription cancellations and offering insight into sales trends. Owens said Paddle will take a 5% to 10% cut of gross purchases, undercutting Apple’s 15% to 30%,",error,513
727," it almost looks like the screen is rolling over the edges thanks to the curved design. The bigger screen is more than just nicer to look at. It’s easier to type in a passcode since the buttons are larger. I liked that I could see more on a map while walking around my neighborhood, and that I can see more text in things like emails or messages that pop up. The watch also offers a touch keyboard that works really well. So, you can swipe or tap out a message right on your wrist to respond to someone. I also like the new Modular Duo watch face, which lets you show more information on the home screen. The bigger screen means I can now see a full breakdown of my next calendar event and all my fitness activity. But you can customize these larger complications to show other data, too, like the song playing, a stock or index you’re watching and the weather forecast. I also like that the new Apple Watch can charge to 80% in 45 minutes. It’s helpful if you just want to top up for a few minutes before bed to have enough battery life for sleep tracking. Apple says an 8-minute charge gives you 8 hours of sleep tracking. I found the fast charging useful one day when, just before a run, I realized I only had about 15% battery left. I charged it while I got dressed and was able to head out with more than a 50% charge. You have to use the new included Apple Watch cable for faster charging. The Series 7 Apple Watch is more durable than any previous version. Apple says the screen is more crack-resistant (both on the glass version and on the more expensive sapphire models.) The watch is also dust resistant for the first time. That’s a feature I’m excited about since I’ve always worn the Apple Watch to the beach but have worried about getting sand in the area around the crown, or in the speakers. Now I don’t have to worry about that. The Series 7 is still rated for up to 50 meters of water resistance anywhere, including in the ocean or pools, so you can swim pretty much wherever you want with it. The Always on Display is a must-have for me, and it works well on the Apple Watch Series 7. I like that I can always glance down and see the time without having to lift my wrist to see it. Apple says it’s now 70% brighter inside with your wrist down, which should make it",error,513
727," easier to see. I’ve never really had a problem reading the screen, though, and couldn’t see a huge difference in brightness. Then there’s everything you get with an Apple Watch. I love the tight integration with the iPhone, so I can get all my notifications anywhere, and that it shows things like the next driving direction while I’m using CarPlay. I regularly buy the cellular model (also available on Series SE) and just leave my phone at home, but still know that I can call my wife or stream music, find my way on a map, talk to Siri or text someone on a run. There are also far more apps than on competitors like Samsung, Fitbit and Garmin. So, you can book an Uber from your wrist or save Spotify songs offline, get more in-depth sleep tracking analysis or listen to an audiobook from Audible. And all models work with Fitness+ if you want to access Apple’s subscription service, which I really like for indoor cycling classes and its new meditation features. My wife uses it for yoga. Like the Series 6 before it, the Series 7 is also the only one that can track blood oxygen, in case you want to keep an eye on that while you’re hiking to higher altitudes. It also has an ECG app if your doctor wants to see that information, though mine has never asked for it and instead runs those sorts of heart tests at her office. I wish it had longer battery life. Apple promises up to 18 hours, and I’ve been getting about that with the Apple Watch Series 7. I just wish Apple could find a way to extend that to two or three days so that I didn’t need to worry about charging it. The faster charger definitely helps, but sometimes I still worry that I’m going to go need to find the charger and top it off before going for a run. But a bigger battery would make it thicker, and I don’t want that either. It comes with a charging cable, but it doesn’t come with the plug. This is part of Apple’s environmental initiatives. The good news is the faster charging works with any 7.5-watt or greater USB-C plug, which you might already have from an iPad or MacBook. You can still charge your Series 7 on an older cable, it just won’t power up as fast as possible. Buy the Series 7 if you can afford it",error,513
728," Apple wants to market the processor improvements. Apple has reportedly been prepping a redesign for its high-end MacBook Pros with its own chips and new ports, including space for an HDMI cable to connect the laptop to monitors, and a magnetic charger, according to Bloomberg. Also in the works is an iMac with a bigger screen and a Mac Mini desktop with more power, according to the report. On Monday, Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of the Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released. Apple’s Mac growth has also been driven by changes the company has made to address some longstanding consumer issues with some products. Between late 2017 and the second fiscal quarter of 2020, Apple reported eight out of 10 quarters of flat or negative annual growth in its Mac business. Growth started taking off in 2020. In 2015, Apple introduced a thinner keyboard design for its laptops, often called the “butterfly keyboard.” In the coming years, the thinner keyboard became standard in Apple’s line of laptops. But the keyboard was plagued by reports that it was unreliable, and that crumbs or dust could make certain keys “sticky” and fail to register or type certain letters twice. Apple has an ongoing service program to fix malfunctioning butterfly keyboards manufactured from 2015 through 2019 for free. It’s also facing a class-action lawsuit over whether it knew that the keyboards were defective. During this period, the biggest new feature addition to Apple’s laptops was the Touch Bar, a strip of touchscreen that replaced the function keys. However, many users found it frustrating and less useful than regular keys. Software developers never flocked to create software for the touchscreen, and Apple’s recent M1 MacBook Air doesn’t have it. Simultaneously, Apple significantly reduced the number of ports on its laptops, streamlining them into a few USB-C connectors. Users complained that they needed adapters, often called dongles, to attach things like mice and external monitors to the laptops, which sometimes used older USB-A connections. The dongles that Apple made were expensive, often costing more than $20 per adapter. The company temporarily slashed prices on adapters in 2016 after users complained. That could change on Monday. Apple’s new MacBook Pro design could include an HDMI port for connecting the laptop to external monitors or TVs, an SD card port for photographers, and a new version of its MagSafe",error,513

In May, the two parties agreed to carve out the weekday games, which reportedly cut ESPN’s fee from $700 million per year to a reported $550 million annually. The new deal runs through 2028, and ESPN retains exclusive rights to “Sunday Night Baseball,” the Home Run Derby and MLB playoff wild card games. While the gap between ESPN’s old deal and the new fee amounts to $150 million a year, industry experts suggested that MLB sought $350 million per year for the weekday rights. Daniel Cohen, senior vice president of Octagon’s global media rights consulting division, said a traditional media company would be unlikely to meet MLB’s asking price. And Turner Sports will add its own weekday game on Tuesday nights as part of its new $3.2 billion package that pays MLB $470 million per year, up from $325 million. But Berke said a cash-rich tech company like Apple would “absolutely” pay it. “Apple has the money to purchase a wide range of sports over and above the MLB package,” Berke said. “But to demonstrate they can do this properly, they have to work their way up the ladder.”  Berke likened Apple’s position to a situation another company faced a century ago. In the early 1920s, electronics manufacturer RCA created radio sets. The company then purchased radio stations and, in 1926, created the National Broadcasting Co. NBC agreed with MLB to air the first World Series on the radio. (NBCUniversal is now the parent of NBC and CNBC.) “RCA was trying to sell radio sets, and Apple is trying to sell headsets,” Berke said. “The same principle applies.” Apple has a whole ecosystem that it can present to consumers, he said. “You need to get in the game if you’re Apple,” Berke said. “If Apple is looking to increase usage of Apple TV+ but also looking to sell additional hardware – phones, watches, iPads – then sports provides you with a ready-made mass audience.” The pandemic changed media consumption, making a deal between MLB and Apple more attractive to both parties. MLB gets younger people, who have become even more glued to their devices for content while stuck at home. And with RSN�",error,513

Apple argues that the bills should give the company the ability to defend its rules under the argument that they “increase consumer welfare.” A spokesperson for Klobuchar disagreed with Apple’s interpretation of her bill. “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against. Let’s be clear – this multi-trillion dollar company is more that capable of  protecting privacy and security while still giving consumers greater choice by allowing competition. The legislation includes strong provisions that all platforms to safeguard user privacy and security.” In a blog post Tuesday, Google’s Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker similarly argued that the bills could make their products less secure by preventing Google from integrating automated security features or making it harder to detect security risks across products if forced to break the connections between them. He also said the bills could force Google to share sensitive data with other companies and that its app store and search engine “might have to give equal prominence to a raft of spammy and low-quality services.” Walker also argued the bills would put American innovation at a disadvantage and ultimately hurt consumers and small businesses that use its services. Still, more than three dozen companies signed a letter Tuesday backing the Klobuchar-Grassley bill, saying alleged self-preferencing by dominant platforms “prevents companies like us from competing on the merits.” The signatories include rivals of Big Tech companies, many of whom have spoken out or even sued some of the large firms in the past, like Basecamp, DuckDuckGo, Genius, Neeva, Proton, Sonos and Yelp. Both bills are scheduled to be marked up by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, where they could become amended and potentially voted to advance to the floor. Even if they are voted out of committee, however, Senate leadership will have to make the time for them to get a vote, amid a mountain of other pressing issues. Tech-funded groups have been pushing back forcefully against the Klobuchar-led bill in particular, with the left-of-center Chamber",error,513
739," Upgraded versions can include an even more powerful M1 Ultra chip. I was able to load and edit high-resolution video in Final Cut Pro quickly and could instantly batch edit dozens of photos in Lightroom. It can render complicated 3D environments and images, in professional apps such as Houdini FX, which requires more performance than 2D video. Everything was speedy, and I’m confident the chip can perform this kind of work for years. And it does all this quietly. Over half of the computer’s internal volume is taken up by an internal heat sink so that the computer runs quietly without spinning its fans. I never heard the fans while testing. I didn’t need the more powerful chip for my workflows, and neither will users who primarily use their computers to send emails, browse the web and watch movies. So, unless you want the fastest computer for bragging rights or you’re designing 3D movies for work, consider the regular Mac Mini for $699 instead. Let’s talk a bit about the Studio Display, which I used with the Mac Studio. It’s a good-looking screen with an aluminum exterior, squared-off angles and a thin black bezel. Its base and footprint are compact given the 27-inch size. I liked that I could easily disconnect it from the Mac Studio and connect it to my work MacBook Pro through a single USB-C cord. It’s seamless. With one USB-C cord, I could charge my laptop, work on a bigger screen and access Apple’s built-in cameras and speakers. The picture quality on the Studio Display is good, but it won’t blow you away. I like that text is nice and sharp thanks to the extra pixels, so people who read on their computer for hours per day might want to consider it. And while it might seem expensive, it’s a lot less than the Pro Display XDR Apple also sells, which costs $4,999 before you add in the $1,000 stand. That’s for video professionals who need a bigger, brighter, 32-inch screen and more accurate colors for work. The front-facing camera on Studio Display is outstanding, thanks to the 12-megapixel sensor, which is a much higher resolution than the 720p built-in camera on my 2018 Apple MacBook. I like that the wide lens captures a lot of the scene around me and that it includes three microphones, which helped me sound clear on",error,513
739," video calls. It was easy to see the difference in Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex meetings. My image was clearer and brighter than before, with less low-light noise. I was impressed by Apple’s Center Stage feature, which automatically moves the monitor’s camera so I remain in the frame even as I fidget. The six-speaker setup is also excellent, although audiophiles will still likely opt for separate studio monitors or headphones. But the built-in speakers are good enough to listen to rock or pop music and more than sufficient for watching movies. Many monitors don’t have built-in speakers or webcams, so both are a nice touch. The Mac Studio is not user-upgradable. Apple says it is “modular,” which refers to the fact that the screen isn’t built-in. But that means power users can’t add additional RAM, graphics cards or storage space, unlike on high-end Windows desktops. It also means any upgrades you want have to be made at the time of purchase, including $400 for additional RAM and as much as $2,400 for 8 terabytes of storage. Those are pricey additions to an already expensive computer. There’s a headphone jack on the back of the Mac Studio, but it’d be more convenient if it was right on the front alongside the USB ports. And while there’s plenty of graphics power for editing videos and photos, gamers who want the latest titles should consider a Windows gaming PC instead, since most new games that take advantage of beefy CPUs and GPUs, such as the recent hit “Elden Ring,” simply aren’t available for the Mac. And, of course, you need to buy a monitor for it. And there are some downsides to the Studio Display, too. I found myself wishing that the Studio Display had more distinguishing features. Apple says it’s powered by an iPhone chip, but it doesn’t have an interface or other common monitor features, such as the ability to switch between inputs without plugging and unplugging cords. You can’t display inputs from multiple computers in split-screen, either, and it doesn’t let you stream media or act as a wireless speaker like some other displays. It also doesn’t support high refresh rates, which makes scrolling smoother and is important for gamers. Apple has started to include the feature on its",error,513
739," phones, laptops and tablets under the marketing name “ProMotion,” so it may become a standard Apple feature during the lifetime of the Studio Display, but as it stands the monitor is less “future-proof.” For most people, this won’t be a deal-breaker. The screen might be too small for some people who have gotten used to massive screens. I use a 32-inch Dell UltraSharp widescreen curved monitor at work. The Studio Display looked small when I first plugged it in, and I found myself missing the curve on my work monitor. But there aren’t many options if you need the 5K resolution. The $1,299 5K LG Ultrafine — now discontinued at Apple stores — is $300 less. It’s the same size and resolution, but it’s not made by Apple and the speakers and webcam are worse. The new products are the culmination of a Mac revival that started over five years ago. In 2017, Apple said that it had formed a new internal group to address the issues that artists, creatives and computer scientists had raised with the state of Apple’s high-end desktop computers, which were rarely updated and languishing at the time. It’s strategic for Apple, even if it sells four laptops for every desktop, as company officials said in 2018. Creative professionals, who have historically preferred Mac computers over Windows, need options on the high end that can support computationally intensive work such as video editing or 3D rendering. In exchange, Apple stays relevant to highly skilled talent and gets a marketing boost from impressive artists using its products. The key to the transition was Apple’s move to dump Intel chips for its own silicon. Apple has succeeded here — I do not recommend Macs with an Intel processor, such as the Mac Pro or some Mac Mini models, because they are getting dated and won’t last as long. The Mac Studio is a new slot in Apple’s lineup for creative pros who are charging the computer to their company, or for people who want the fastest Mac available and don’t care how much it costs. Reminder, you’re spending $1,999 before you even add in the $1,599 screen. Combined, you’re spending $3,598 before taxes. But you know what you’re getting if you spend that much, and I think you’ll like it. More cost-sensitive buyers who",error,513

That’s the small magnetic charging cable that pops onto the side and easily pops back out. So, if you trip on the cord, the whole MacBook won’t come smashing off your desk. You can also charge the laptop using one of two Thunderbolt USB C ports. You can fast charge it up to 50% in 30 minutes if you buy Apple’s 67-watt charger for $59. The charger should have been included in the entry-level model, but Apple offers it for free if you step up to the 512GB version. I prefer fast charging, and the charger worked well, so I suggest buying it. The M2 chip was plenty fast for my needs, such as running lots of tabs in Safari, playing music, watching movies or light gaming. I thought the M1 was great, too, so people coming from that chip may not notice a huge difference unless you’re timing things such as video rendering speeds. And, if you’re the sort of person who really needs a ton of speed, you should just get the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Apple promises 18 hours of battery life with the screen set at about 50% brightness. I did a video rundown test, just looping a movie nonstop until the battery died, and got just over 17 hours. I was streaming the movie and had things such as the keyboard lights on, which both impact battery life. It will get you through a work day and beyond, and you’ll definitely have plenty of battery life to watch movies throughout an entire flight. The name of the M2 chip can be confusing: It’s faster than the M1, but it’s not more powerful than the M1 Pro or M1 Max in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. And it’s more limited than those chips. You can add only one external monitor, for example, as opposed to two with the M1 Pro or four with the M1 Max. That’s the same limitation as the M1 chip, and it’s a bummer for people like me who usually run two extra monitors. Apple also finally upgraded the camera from 720p to full 1080p HD. It’s better, but I think",error,513
759," from Musk speaking up about Taiwan is that even if they won’t speak out as political actors, they should at least be speaking clearly about the potential risks to their businesses, and their own intentions for business relationships in China, and planning mitigation strategies now. “Global corporations have a say here and it is time for people to speak more clearly like Elon about the potential outcomes and make it clear they are uncomfortable, and start to vote with your feet,” he said. That means de-risking supply chains to decrease dependence on China and make it clear that the heightened geopolitical tensions and threat to Taiwan are a concern, he added. But McNeal stressed that his view remains that China won’t act anytime soon. “I don’t think it’s imminent but I do think companies should heed what he [Musk] says.” The U.S. government policy remains to not take an official position on Taiwan as an independent and sovereign state. McNeal said China still has “too many problems at home to deal with,” and isn’t sure it can win in a military invasion scenario now. But companies and their investors can’t procrastinate. “By that I mean don’t navel gaze... whistle past the graveyard,” McNeal said, adding that China’s strategies to assert more control over Taiwan are not limited to invasion. “If I’m on the board of a company with exposure or I am an investor, I am going to start to press on what the plan is to de-risk,” he said. “Use this time between now and when a scenario may be one China could execute on, to plan and get prepared. I would not sit back and wait.” The business world was given a preview of the “conjoined nature” of the global economy when the Trump and Biden administrations began a crackdown on China’s technology sector and access to key U.S. tech. During the chip shortages of Covid, McNeal told CNBC of the tech cold war, “what frightens me the most is the geopolitical... the politics of this is just getting starting in Washington and Beijing,” he said. “I don’t know if industry is quite prepared to really understand how bad it is going to get between Washington and Beijing.” More recently, when Russia invaded Ukraine, the market was given a preview of all",error,513
764,"�What Apple is showing with their announcement last week is that there are technical weaknesses that they are willing to build in,” CDT project director Emma Llanso said in an interview. “It seems so out of step from everything that they had previously been saying and doing.” Apple declined to comment for this story. It has said it will refuse requests from governments to use the system to check phones for anything other than illegal child sexual abuse material. Outsiders and employees pointed to Apple’s stand against the FBI in 2016, when it successfully fought a court order to develop a new tool to crack into a terrorism suspect’s iPhone. Back then, the company said that such a tool would inevitably be used to break into other devices for other reasons. But Apple was surprised its stance then was not more popular, and the global tide since then has been toward more monitoring of private communication. With less publicity, Apple has made other technical decisions that help authorities, including dropping a plan to encrypt widely used iCloud backups and agreeing to store Chinese user data in that country. A fundamental problem with Apple’s new plan on scanning child abuse images, critics said, is that the company is making cautious policy decisions that it can be forced to change, now that the capability is there, in exactly the same way it warned would happen if it broke into the terrorism suspect’s phone. Apple says it will scan only in the United States and other countries to be added one by one, only when images are set to be uploaded to iCloud, and only for images that have been identified by the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children and a small number of other groups. But any country’s legislature or courts could demand that any one of those elements be expanded, and some of those nations, such as China, represent enormous and hard to refuse markets, critics said. Police and other agencies will cite recent laws requiring “technical assistance” in investigating crimes, including in the United Kingdom and Australia, to press Apple to expand this new capablity, the EFF said. “The infrastructure needed to roll out Apple’s proposed changes makes it harder to say that additional surveillance is not technically feasible,” wrote EFF General Counsel Kurt Opsahl. Lawmakers will build on it as well, said Neil Brown, a U.K. tech lawyer at decoded.legal: “If Apple demonstrates that, even in just one market, it can carry out on-device content filtering, I",error,513
765," on buybacks and dividends since it started its capital return program in 2012. In 2011, Apple had 929,409,000 shares outstanding. In October it had 17,001,802,000 shares outstanding, but that was after a 4-1 stock split in 2020 and a 7-1 stock split in 2014. As of October, Apple had the equivalent of 607,207,214 in 2011 shares outstanding, or a 35% decrease since Cook took over. Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company, worth more than $2.4 trillion, edging out other giants such as Microsoft and Amazon. One thing propelling Apple’s market cap is the company’s new focus on its services business. The catch-all category includes software subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, App Store downloads and a portion of transactions users make in the apps they download, AppleCare warranties, money from Google to make its search engine the default on iPhone, and cuts from its Apple Pay payments service. Apple first started to call attention to the previously sleepy category in 2015 as iPhone growth slowed. Apple has started to release new products to bolster its services that bill on a recurring basis, including Apple News+, a digital magazine bundle, and Apple TV+, a competitor to Netflix. It’s also bundling its services in a subscription called Apple One. Most recently, it’s started to add privacy features to paid iCloud accounts. The growth of Apple’s services business from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2011 to $53.77 billion in fiscal 2020 has given investors confidence that it can find new revenue streams even as iPhone sales slow. Jobs was known as a product-focused CEO who was involved in the development of new devices from their conception until they were on store shelves. Cook isn’t as product focused as his predecessor, but his Apple has managed to launch several new successful products. In 2015, Apple released Apple Watch, a companion for the iPhone that tracked heart rate, displayed notifications and worked with a variety compatible watch bands from fashion brands like Hermes. While Apple has never released unit sales numbers or even direct revenue from the watch, one estimate from Counterpoint Research says that Apple shipped 33.9 million watches in 2020, far outpacing Huawei, the second-place company, which only shipped 11 million smartwatches. Apple also released AirPods in 2016. Similarly, Apple has never announced financial results from the AirPods, but the company’s wireless headphones accounted for just under half of",error,513
765," wireless headphone sales in 2020, according to Strategy Analytics. In 2011, Apple’s “other” category, at the time called “peripherals and other hardware,” reported $2.3 billion in sales. By 2020, after being bolstered by the release of both Apple Watch and AirPods, it had more than $30.6 billion in revenue and the moniker Wearables, Home and Accessories. Apple’s main product remains the iPhone, which accounted for 47% of the company’s sales in the most recent quarter. But under Cook’s watch, the iPhone has improved on a rigorous annual release schedule. When Cook took over, the most advanced iPhone was the iPhone 4, with a 5 megapixel camera and a 3.5-inch screen. Modern iPhone 12 devices can come with as many as three cameras, 6.7-inch screens and an Apple-designed processor that rivals the fastest computer chips. Prices have risen, too — the iPhone 4 cost $599 for an entry-level model ($199 with a carrier contract). Today, Pro models start at $999. A month after Cook took over, Apple had 60,400 full-time employees. Now it has 147,000 full-time employees in countries around the world, according to a filing last fall. Apple’s global operations will create new challenges for the company. Cook personally navigated a relationship with former President Donald Trump as the U.S. placed tariffs on parts and products that Apple imports. It also faces pressure from China and other governments over the apps it has in its store and how it operates its cloud services. In the U.S., Apple has been lumped in with other dominant tech companies as having too much power. In Apple’s case, regulators and critics have focused on the App Store, the only way for consumers to install software on an iPhone. Detractors claim it has arbitrary rules and decry Apple’s cut of 30% of most purchases, which they say is too much. Later this year, a judge in Oakland, California, will decide whether Apple broke antirust laws, prompted by a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games. Cook testified in court for the first time as CEO during that trial. Apple also faces legislation currently being debated in Congress which would force the company to change the way it administers its software stores. Apple has denied that it holds a monopoly over its app store. Apple also gets questions about what",error,513
774," product, Apple Search Ads, which marketers are turning to for mobile ads that drive app installations. “We’ve really seen a huge increase in Apple search ads market share,” said Shani Rosenfelder, head of content for AppsFlyer, an ad measurement firm. “They’ve become the new number one player, and they passed Facebook, which dominated iOS in the past.” It took a few months before advertisers started seeing the full effects of Apple’s changes as iPhone owners update their software. The update divided iPhone users into two categories: Those who opt-in to device tracking for ads, and those who don’t. 86% of iOS devices are running a recent enough version of the software to be presented with ATT prompts, according to an October report from AppsFlyer. Of the people who see the pop-up, 38% are opting-in, and 62% are opting-out. Users who opt-in have become even more valuable to advertisers, who can use the data they get from them to fine-tune campaigns for the users who opted-out, said Rosenfelder. “We see that the cost of media is increasing, especially for the users who have consented to tracking, because they’re really valuable,” Rosenfelder said. Several companies have signaled through their earnings that the ATT change is affecting them, but they remain optimistic that they can build new attribution systems using Apple’s replacement or their own first-party data, and tune targeting with data they have, like purchase history or similar demographics. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been vocal about its opposition to the feature, which at times has seemed targeted at the social networking company. For example, Cook specifically mentioned Facebook in a tweet showing a picture of the privacy prompt. Facebook has reacted by constructing its own systems inside the apps it builds, like the ability to buy products directly from Facebook, which reduces the need for third-party tracking. “As Apple changes make e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that allow big businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important to them,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had previously praised Apple’s approach in interviews, and the company has updated its ad products to work with Apple’s ATT replacement. But last month, Snap officials said Apple’s replacement for advertising measurement, SKAdNetwork",error,513
774,", was unreliable. “Over time, we saw [SKAdNetwork] measurement results diverge meaningfully from the results we observed on other first and third-party measurement solutions, making Scan unreliable at a stand-alone measurement solution,” Snap chief business officer Jeremi Gorman said. Snap is speeding up the development of its own first-party technology to help its customers, the company said. Peloton is one example of a company that can no longer acquire customers in the same way it did before the change, citing challenges related to Apple’s privacy change. But Peloton also said that it believes it can adapt and that its app business will remain an important way to acquire customers. “Like many other direct-to-consumer marketers, we’re seeing some disruptive impact as our teams adjust to the new data landscape,” Peloton’s CFO, Jill Woodworth, said earlier this month. ATT has attracted attention to Apple’s advertising business, which focuses specifically on mobile ads for apps. Apple’s most notable ad product is Apple Search Ads. It allows developers to buy keywords on the Apple App Store to appear at the top of searches. Apple doesn’t break out search ads in its financial results, but it is a small part of its services business, which reported $68.43 billion in revenue in the company’s fiscal 2021, an increase of 27%. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated in a note to clients last week that Apple’s search advertising generates $4 billion annually and has 60% of the app search ad market share on iPhones. Search ads are only a fraction of the entire mobile ad market, the Bernstein analyst wrote. He estimates that the mobile ad market as a whole is worth $300 billion per year, and 20% of those ads are for mobile apps, or about $60 billion, with iOS accounting for half of that pie. Last quarter, Apple reported over $83 billion in total sales, so even if Apple massively expanded its advertising business, it still wouldn’t be a major revenue source for the iPhone maker. Apple’s products may be more competitive because they can access targeting data that other ad companies can’t. Apple’s ATT focuses on limiting data transfer between third parties, which doesn’t apply to Apple’s first-party advertising. “I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple who have the direct data themselves,”",error,513

But if you have the budget, the iPhone 13 Mini is the same size with a way better screen, slightly longer battery life, and nicer cameras.  The 5G works well, too. It doesn’t support some of the fastest mmWave networks that other iPhone and Android devices can, but those networks aren’t widely available anyway. More importantly, it does support the new C-band networks that are being rolled out by Verizon and AT&T, as well as T-Mobile’s solid nationwide 5G network. So, while 5G still isn’t a must-have for most people, it’s great if you need to download a big playlist or a couple of TV shows before you hop on a flight. In my tests, T-Mobile’s 5G network hit about 300Mbps at home, which was faster than my Wi-Fi in parts of my house.  The camera is good but it’s definitely one area where you can feel the cost savings. It’s got the same lens as the 2020 model but still takes slightly better pictures thanks to the image signal processor that comes with the latest A15 chip. Portrait shots, which nicely blur the background of your subject, can be taken of people, but it doesn’t detect pets for those images. There’s no night mode, which means shots taken in the dark aren’t as clear as they are on Apple’s more expensive phones. But it took nice, clean shots and did a good job capturing the deep reds of some tulips. The front-facing camera is solid for selfies with nice color and tone balance. Finally, while it’s not as water-resistant as Apple’s other iPhones, it can still survive a dunk in the bath or a spill without any worry, and has the same strong glass as other iPhones to help prevent shattering if you drop it. It doesn’t feel cheap like some low-cost Android phones, which often use plastic instead of glass and metal.  The iPhone SE isn’t really made for power users, and that shows in the battery life.

[PRO] AI’s next bottleneckWhile chipmakers and hyperscalers bask in the limelight of AI’s infrastructure boom, savvy investors are already eyeing the next bottleneck: networking. Large language models and other AI applications demand high bandwidth and low latency, creating a lucrative opportunity for those who can provide the robust networks required for AI’s future.  Despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates and forecasting only one cut for the remainder of 2024, Lazard’s chief market strategist Ronald Temple anticipates further reductions. He advises investors, “Don’t take too much direction from today’s FOMC ‘dot plot.’ As upcoming inflation and labor reports confirm easing price pressures and labor market tightness, I expect FOMC members to reassess their forecasts to include more rate cuts by year-end.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed Temple’s sentiment, saying May’s strong jobs data might be slightly “overstated,” indicating revisions could be on the way. ”...There’s an argument that they may be a bit overstated, but still, they’re strong,” Powell said, referring to U.S. payroll reports. “We see gradual cooling,",error,513
804," gradual moving toward better balance.”  With the Fed and inflation data out of the way, the next big event for investors is whether shareholders will approve Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay deal today. The problem for Musk, even if he gets his way, is that he’s facing numerous lawsuits.  Many large investors who, back in 2018, voted against the compensation package have said they’ll do the same again. CalPERS,  CalSTRS, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund and advisory groups ISS and Glass Lewis are against the proposal, but he does have his backers.  The Delaware court, in voiding the original deal, highlighted concerns about the remuneration committee’s independence. Tesla’s chair, Robyn Denholm, for instance, cashed in $280 million in stock, while others on the committee had deep-rooted business or personal ties to Musk.  Further raising eyebrows, Musk asked his former divorce lawyer, Todd Maron, who was also drafting the compensation package, to arrange a call with a dissenting shareholder to “convince them to divest from Tesla and any of [his] companies.”  While some fear Musk might abandon Tesla, the court deemed this unlikely.   Gordon Johnson, CEO of GLJ Research, offered a different perspective to CNBC: “Musk had long ago mentally checked out of Tesla. But he’s not going to leave. He’s going to do what he has done for years. He’s going to milk Tesla to support his other businesses.”  Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing Musk of making billions of dollars by selling Tesla shares using insider information. It’s similar to another lawsuit accusing Musk of insider trading when he sold $7.5 billion in stock.  ERSRI’s lawsuit says Musk has been disloyal towards Tesla by diverting employees to work for X. And here’s the crux of what some big investors and the Delaware court have been saying: Tesla’s board of directors independence from Musk is “questionable.”   However, Musk posted on X his gratitude to shareholders who have already voted to approve his pay package and move Tesla’s legal home to Texas “by wide margins",error,513

Before Cook was questioned by Rogers, he testified on Friday that Apple faces fierce competition in smartphones and that in the United States, the iPhone has only a “high 30s” percentage of market share. Internationally, the iPhone has about 15% market share, Cook said. The market share figures cited by Cook are a rare example of Apple discussing the market share of its most important product, the iPhone, in an effort to say it does not dominate the smartphone market. “There’s a whole list of different handset competitors. It’s fiercely competitive,” Cook said. Apple’s U.S. share cited by Cook is lower than many external estimates. For example, a recent report from Counterpoint Research pegged it at between 40% and 65%, depending on the quarter, since 2019. Apple has argued that its control of its App Store, the only way for consumers to install software on iPhones, is essential for the company’s security and privacy promises to its users, and an important distinguishing feature in a competitive market for smartphones. “We could no longer make the promise of privacy, safety, and security” if Epic Games prevails, Cook testified, saying that the App Store would be a “toxic mess” without Apple’s rules and policies that Epic is fighting in court. Epic Games argues security is an excuse to extract fees and control what software makers do, and that Apple could safely open up its platform to competing app stores. Cook mentioned Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, Huawei and Google as handset competitors, all of which use a version of Google’s Android. He said Apple also faces competition from other app stores, including Google Play, and consoles such as Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation. When questioned by Epic Games lawyers, Cook declined to answer a question about whether Apple’s iPhone competes with Google’s Android in the operating system market. “Customers don’t buy operating systems. They buy devices,” Cook said. Cook said that Apple uses surveys to track whether iPhone users switch to Android devices. “Making efforts to get Android people to switch to iPhone, that’s a very important task for us,” Cook said. Cook said on Friday that Epic Games’ move last year to bypass Apple’s 30% in-app purchase fees on Fortnite, its shooter game,",error,513

Previously, precise and pricey camera setups were required for detailed object scanning.  Eventually, third party developers like Unity, a top AR engine maker, will include it in their software. For now, it will likely be used heavily in e-commerce. RealityKit 2. Object Capture is just one part of a significant update to RealityKit, which is its set of software tools for making AR experiences. Aside from Object Capture, there are a lot of little improvements to make app makers’ lives easier in RealityKit 2, including  improved rendering options, a way to organize images and other assets, and new tools to make player-controlled characters inside augmented reality scenes. ARKit 5. ARKit is another set of software tools for making AR experiences, but is more closely focused on figuring out where to place digital objects in the real world. This is Apple’s fifth major version of the software since it first came out in 2017. This year it includes something called “location anchors,” which means that software makers can program AR experiences pegged to map locations in in London, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and a few other U.S. In a video session for developers, Apple said it is using the tool to create AR direction overlays in Apple Maps -- a potentially useful scenario for a head-mounted AR device. AI for understanding hands, people, and faces. While Apple’s machine learnings and artificial intelligence tools aren’t directly tied to augmented reality, they represent abilities that will be important for a computer interface that works in 3D spaces. Apple’s Vision framework software can be called by apps to detect people, faces, and poses through the iPhone’s camera. Apple’s computer vision software can now identify objects inside images, including text on signs, as well as the ability to search for things inside photos — like a dog or a friend. Combined with Apple’s other tools, these AI tools can apply affects similar to Snap’s filters.

813," to $8 per month for Disney+ or $8.99 for a standard Netflix plan. When Apple TV+ was launched in November 2019, it had nine original, Apple-backed shows and movies. Now it has around 87 original TV shows, movies and documentaries. That’s nowhere near what other services offer. Hulu, for example, has thousands of shows, according to Reelgood data, many of which already have large fanbases because they were broadcast on TV. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video both have more than 1,000 licensed and original shows for customers to watch. Apple has not licensed any non-exclusive shows for its service, and instead is only offering shows it financially backed. It hasn’t spent to buy media companies to fill out its back catalog, unlike Amazon, which recently agreed to acquire MGM Studios. Most of Apple’s shows star big-named producers and actors, such as Oprah and Steven Spielberg. However, talent is not exclusively tied to the company. Oprah’s biggest interview in recent memory, with Prince Harry, was broadcast on CBS. Steven Spielberg recently signed a deal with Netflix, too.  Streaming ratings are notoriously secretive, and Apple’s never revealed how many viewers any of its shows have. When Apple executives are asked about the success of its content, they point to award nominations. In a press release last week, Apple said that its original shows have received 112 awards and 389 nominations, including Critics Choice awards, Golden Globes, and Oscars.  “No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a call with analysts in April. Cook went on to praise one show in particular, “Ted Lasso,” which looks like Apple TV+‘s first big hit. The breezy comedy about an American soccer coach, which was based on an NBC advertisement poking fun at Americans’ ignorance about soccer, found a fanbase with its low-stakes banter. “Ted Lasso” season 2 will premier on July 23 and Apple will release new episodes weekly with an aim to get current subscribers on the trial hooked and potentially find new subscribers. A promotional email sent to subscribers this week highlights “Ted Lasso” in addition to a second season of “The Morning Show” starring Jennifer Aniston premiering in September. The email also promoted shows that have",error,513
813," yet to premier, such as a comedy starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd called “The Shrink Next Door” and the sci-fi series “Foundation” based on Issac Asimov’s books. Still, “Ted Lasso” is a 30-minute comedy with only 10 episodes currently available, and overall, Apple’s library of content still trails far behind rivals. “Apple’s not in a position of strength here,” Moffett Nathanson’s Michael Nathanson said. “Although they have some excellent shows, they lack the scale of new releases, tentpole titles and a deep library to really create a large profitable business at this point.” It’s hard to figure out how Apple TV+ stacks up to Disney or Netflix in terms of subscribers because Apple doesn’t release stats. Netflix has 208 million subscribers around the world. It would also be surprising if Apple can match Disney+’s 100 million subscribers, which it has built since Apple TV+ debuted. Analysts are reluctant to offer estimates, but based on the number of smartphones Apple sells per year, tens of millions of people could have taken the promotional offer for Apple TV. Apple sold 206 million iPhones globally in 2020, according to an IDC estimate, and that doesn’t include the other Apple products that come with a free trial. Eleven percent of U.S. households with a high-speed internet connection subscribe to Apple TV+, according to Parks Associates survey data. There are about 103 million households with broadband, according to Census data. The percent of subscribers who could end up churning is also foggy. A Moffett Nathanson analysis of survey data suggests 29% percent of Apple TV+ subscribers don’t plan to renew and 41% aren’t sure yet. Only 30% said they planned to continue subscribing to Apple TV+. But Apple never said it planned to take on Netflix, Nason said, so the total number of subscribers may not be that important to the company. He thinks that Apple TV+ is another one of several services designed to get users hooked on iPhones and Apple services, in line with Apple’s overall corporate strategy. “Apple wants to get you into their ecosystem through a device purchase, and once you get in there, they go, ‘We’ll give you Apple TV+. We also have Apple Music, podcasts, news, fitness, you can bundle them or you",error,513
815,". Now there is more regulatory pressure from countries and developers around the world, and it is leading to more rule changes. Apple made some of the recent concessions because of settlements in a developer class action lawsuit in the United States and an agreement with Japan’s Fair Trade Commission, although Apple is applying the changes around the world. Those tweaks essentially allow companies like Spotify and Tinder’s parent company Match Group to bypass Apple’s sometimes 30% cut of gross sales, addressing a standing complaint that dates back at least five years. Apple also reduced its take to 15% for news apps that participate in Apple News, its own news app. Apple officials say they are meaningful changes that address key concerns from software makers. Some of Apple’s opponents, even those that have petitioned for those changes, say that they don’t go far enough, and are part of a pattern of dividing its critics by placating some of them with one-off rule changes. “Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek tweeted this week in response to Apple’s in-app linking rule change. “Apple’s strategy is Divide and Conquer: carve off special deals for different developer segments,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said last month in a statement to CNBC in response to Apple’s news app concession. Epic Games is suing Apple seeking to be able to install its own app store on iPhones — which is the big change that Apple wants to fight off. 2009: Apple does not approve Google Voice, FCC investigates. A year after the App Store went live, the FCC started probing it over its refusal to approve the Google Voice app, which acted as a second phone number. Apple responded to the FCC, providing many details about its app review process for the first time, and arguing that it had the right to reject entire categories of apps. In its letter, Apple also detailed for the first time its Executive Review Board, a body headed by Apple executive Phil Schiller, which makes final decisions on “new and complex issues.” The Google Voice app was eventually approved in late 2010. 2011: Apple requires in-app payments for digital goods, creates the “reader rule.” In-app purchases with a 30% fee were introduced in early 2009. But in February 2011, Apple significantly tightened its control over the App Store by announcing it planned to force companies to use Apple�",error,513
815,"�s in-app purchase system if they offered digital subscriptions. At first, Apple offered exceptions for products like Kindle or the New York Times, where users may have purchased e-books or digital subscriptions off-app. But companies still needed to implement in-app purchases with Apple’s cut, at the same price as their off-app subscriptions. This didn’t work for many publishers, who wanted to retain their direct relationship with customers. By June, Apple had backtracked on some of its more draconian guidelines, allowing companies to pass on the 30% fee to customers or to, if they chose, not offer an Apple in-app purchase at all. Shortly afterwards, Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller started to question Apple’s 30% fee, and suggested lower revenue sharing levels, such as 20%, according to an email released as part of the Epic Games trial. This is when Apple started to put its first restrictions on redirecting users in-app to the publisher’s website, which were reversed in recent weeks. 2016: Apple reduces cut for 2nd year of subscriptions to 15%. By 2015, Spotify had publicly challenged tested Apple’s restrictions on subscriptions, first by emailing customers to tell them it’s less expensive to subscribe directly, instead of through the App Store. This was against Apple’s guidelines, and its one of the rules that was officially clarified as part of Apple’s concessions last month. Shortly afterwards, Spotify removed Apple in-app purchases entirely and started a process of challenging Apple’s rules with government regulators. In 2016, Apple announced that it would alter its revenue sharing agreement, specifically for subscription apps. Apple still charged 30% for the first year of a subscription, but subscribers who lasted more than 12 months would cost the app a lower, 15% rate of gross sales. Apple also opened subscription billing to all App Store apps and introduced search ads, which let developers pay for better placement on an App Store search page. The announcement was also months after Schiller publicly took over oversight of the App Store, replacing services head Eddy Cue, although Schiller had been involved with App Store policy since the beginning. Although Schiller is no longer a senior vice president at Apple, he remains an Apple employee with the title “fellow,” and continues to lead App Store policy. 2019: Apple backtracks on parental control apps, introduces appeals process. By the time Apple’s annual developer conference kicked off in",error,513
815," 2020, the App Store had received considerable antitrust attention, specifically to its ability to reject apps, especially apps that competed with Apple features, such as parental control apps which gave users the ability to set screen time limits for kids. Apple reversed some of its policies about parental control apps in 2019 after negative media attention, allowing some of them onto the store, and creating software tools that they could use to build their apps. But the skirmish highlighted that Apple’s App Review process was arbitrary, and sometimes held up app updates over minor details or, worse, because the app didn’t comply with in-app purchase rules. Developer protests over App Review continued to grow through 2020, and at Apple’s annual developer’s conference, Apple said that it would implement an appeals system for developers to challenge Apple’s rules, although many app makers say it hasn’t solved their complaints with the approval process. 2020: Apple reduces cut to 15% for small companies. Last November, Apple introduced the Small Business Program, a high-profile olive branch to lawmakers and app developers. It reduced the take from 30% to 15% for any company making less than $1 million per year through the App Store. But because apps are a winner-take-most business, it didn’t hurt Apple’s finances too badly — one estimate at the time suggested the top 1% of app publishers generate 93% of App Store revenue. But it did cut the fees for the majority of individual app developers. Documents from a settlement in 2021 said that the creation of the Small Business Program was because of a class-action lawsuit. 2021: Apple reduces cut to 15% for news apps that participate in Apple News, allows developers to direct users to alternative payment systems. Antitrust attention on the App Store heated up in 2021. Earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook testified at a trial over App Store practices against Epic Games. Multiple states and the U.S. Congress saw bills introduced which could force Apple to allow alternative app stores. In August, Apple reduced its subscription cut for any publisher from 30% to 15%, addressing a segment of developers who had fought off App Store changes back in 2011. There was a catch though — those news apps had to participate in Apple’s news aggregator.( News apps are not the main moneymaker on the App Store.) Apple also settled a class-action lawsuit with smaller U.S. developers, paying $100 million and clarifying guidelines about apps emailing their",error,513
818,"saving design, according to Kuo. In previous years, new iPhones have come with camera and processor upgrades, and that’s almost certain to happen this year, according to Kuo. We don’t know yet what Apple will call the new iPhones. Apple has named some previous devices “S” devices signifying mainly internal changes, which would fit in with this year’s expectations. That means it could be called the iPhone 12s, or it could be named the iPhone 13 if Apple decides the changes are enough to warrant it. We don’t know yet. Apple has released new Apple Watch models every September since 2016. It’s a key product in Apple’s wearables business, which accounted for 11% of Apple’s 2020 sales. Last year, Apple introduced the high-end Series 6 and the mid-range Apple Watch SE. This year’s high-end Apple Watch is likely called the Apple Watch Series 7. Kuo predicted last year that the 2021 models would be a “significant form factor design change.” The design will also include a slight increase in screen size, according to Bloomberg News, which would be equivalent to 16% more pixels on the watch’s display. Bloomberg said Apple will introduce new watch faces to take advantage of the larger screens, including one that would allow a user to see all 24 time zones simultaneously. Some Apple Watch models may be in short supply due to production issues. Nikkei Asia said this month Apple delayed manufacturing because of assembly challenges. The report also suggested Apple could add blood-pressure sensing this year, but The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have said the feature won’t come this year. Apple declined to comment on Watch production. In past years, when Apple has had issues producing millions of devices ahead of a launch, it delayed the release date by weeks or months after the presentation. In 2017, for example, it announced the iPhone X in September but didn’t ship it until November. AirPods are a key component of Apple’s wearables business, which accounted for over $30 billion in annual revenue in 2020, a 25% increase over 2019. Although the product is growing in importance to Apple, the company hasn’t launched new AirPods since October 2019 when it introduced the higher-end AirPods Pro with a new design and noise canceling. The most recent regular $159 AirPods, without noise canceling, were announced in",error,513
818," March 2019. In a note to investors over the weekend, Kuo said Apple will launch a new AirPods 3. He said Apple may continue to sell the current AirPods at a lower price. The redesign will likely make the AirPods look more like AirPods Pro, with a wider case and shorter stems, according to Bloomberg. If Apple announces new iPads, it will emphasize how important the product has become for the company as the Covid-19 pandemic forced people to work and learn from home, driving a boost in computer sales. In the first three quarters in Apple’s fiscal 2021, the company has reported $23.6 billion of iPads revenue, an over 39% increase from last year. Apple last updated the iPad Air, a midrange option, with an edge-to-edge screen in September 2020. Apple has also updated the chip in its least expensive iPad, a $329 tablet that it simply calls iPad, at the same event. Those are due for a refresh this fall, though it’s unclear if that will happen on Tuesday or at a second event. But the iPad Mini, last refreshed in March 2019, is most overdue for a refresh. The iPad Mini could be getting a redesign by the end of the year to make it look more like its siblings, according to Bloomberg. The report said it won’t have a home button and will have a more square design like Apple’s iPad Air and Pro. That means it could have a fingerprint reader in the power button like the iPad Air, or Face ID like the iPad Pro. This is a product event, so don’t expect any commentary from Tim Cook on recent controversies including its plan to scan iCloud uploads for illegal material, the recent mixed decision in the App Store lawsuit against Epic Games, or thoughts on the company’s decision to delay a return to in-office work until next year. However, Apple sometimes uses its iPhone launches to highlight nonproduct projects, such as its efforts to become carbon neutral across its supply chain in the next 10 years. If Apple talks about its climate efforts, expect VP Lisa Jackson to address the audience. Past events also have included musical guests or celebrity appearances. Apple sometimes releases new services at fall launches, such as Apple One, its bundle of subscription services, which began last year. But the big update to iOS is announced in June, at the company’s developer conference, and is typically released to everyone in the fall. There’s another",error,513
824," won’t be sent back to Apple. More control of notifications during off-hours. For a few years, iPhone users have had a mode called “Do Not Disturb” that limited notifications except from a list of close contacts. These features have received a big upgrade in iOS 15 that Apple calls “Focus.” The main feature shows only notifications from people and apps you’ve pre-approved. If someone is texting a user who is in Focus Mode, they’ll receive a message that notifications have been silenced, sort of like an away message. Users can create multiple Focus profiles for different situations, such as work, play and sleep. It will allow users to create special home screens so they can, for example, have different collections of apps for work or home. Apple Maps reminders. Apple Maps comes with annual improvements, including better directions, public transit schedules, and an augmented reality walking directions feature that places big arrows over scenes of the real world telling users where to go. But commuters will probably like best the new real-time alerts that tell users when they need to get off the bus, train or subway before they miss their stop. New Safari redesign. The default browser on the iPhone is getting its biggest redesign in years, bringing the address bar and back button from the top of the screen closer to the bottom to make it easier for thumbs to reach. If you don’t like the new Safari, you can change it back to the old look. Safari will also save groups of open tabs, so you can come back to them later, and supports extensions — just like Google Chrome or Safari on the desktop — for the first time through Apple’s app stores. Extensions are little apps that let you do more on a site, such as block ads, but there aren’t a lot available yet. Better system search. Apple’s Spotlight is a power-user feature that searches the web and your files and makes apps easier to access. Users access it when swiping down from the top of the screen. It has a new look this year, with more photos, and Apple-provided information about TV shows, movies, musicians, and links that have been shared with you. Privacy protections. Apple has emphasized privacy in recent years, but in iOS 15 it’s starting to become a feature worth upgrading for. One new feature is called “App Privacy Report,” and it will show you how often an app accessed your microphone or location over the last",error,513
825," listen to music, continue texting with friends or check in on my fantasy football team. I’ve been a big iPad Mini fan since the first model was introduced, and I dig that it’s all-screen now, without a home button. Instead, there’s a small fingerprint reader in the power button, just like on the iPad Air. It takes some getting used to if you’re used to a home button or Face ID on an iPhone or iPad. It has Apple’s latest A15 processor, which gives it a 40% processor bump and 80% graphics bump from the A12 chip used in its predecessor. It’s a noticeable change over my aging iPad Mini from 2019, especially now that Apple’s latest iPad update includes things like home screen widgets and improved multitasking. The graphics bump really just means it will hold up to the latest games and photo or video editing apps better than the last version, though serious photogs should consider the Pro models, which are more powerful. Apple also added a 5G option to the iPad Mini for the first time, which means you can download apps, music and movies faster if you’re away from home. But you’ll pay an additional $150 for 5G support. It doesn’t support the fastest mmwave flavor of 5G like the iPhones and iPad Pro do, but those mmwave networks are still really sparse and you need to be standing near the tower to use them, so I don’t think that’s a huge loss right now. The cameras also received a much-needed upgrade. I don’t take photos with my iPad, since the one on my iPhone is always better and easier to reach for, but it’s a sharper 12-megapixel resolution and is still useful for snapping pictures of documents or other things you need to sign. The front-facing 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens is a more important upgrade. It replaces the lower-quality 7-megapixel camera on the older model and now supports Center Stage, which made its debut in the iPads Pro in May. It’s a great new feature, also in the new regular iPad, which tracks you as you move around during a video chat. It works great and I’m glad Apple started to bring this to all of its iPads instead of just the more expensive Pro models. Several other updates bring the iPad Mini on par with its more expensive siblings. It",error,513
825," has stereo speakers so you don’t hear sound coming out of just one side while watching a movie, a nice improvement from the older model. It also uses USB-C charging just like other iPads and MacBooks instead of Apple’s Lightning plug that is uses on iPhones. I just wish Apple would ditch the Lightning charger on its iPhones, too, so I could carry just one cable with me. I don’t use the Apple Pencil often, but it’s super handy to have when I need to sign something. The new iPad Mini supports the better second-generation Apple Pencil, which sticks to the side of the tablet and charges magnetically. I used it to sign several child-care documents. Artists might like the feature that allows the smaller iPad to double as a portable sketchbook. Plus, the iPad software also supports the pencil for all sorts of stuff, such as writing in search bars, converting notes from handwriting to text and dragging and dropping photos. It’s useful to keep the pencil in your bag for when you need it. Battery life remains about the same as the last iPad mini. Apple promises up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching videos or listening to music. That drops to nine hours if you’re on cellular. I found those claims are pretty accurate, using the device for about three hours per night three nights in a row for reading and browsing Reddit before I needed to recharge it. As usual, your mileage will vary depending on what you’re doing. Playing games will drain it faster, for example. The volume buttons take some getting used to. They’re on the top if you’re holding the tablet in portrait mode, instead of on the side like on other iPads. I’m spoiled by the far nicer ProMotion displays on the iPads Pro. It’s just a lot smoother for scrolling through a news article or apps like Twitter. Apple sees ProMotion as something for professionals, though, which is also why it’s included only on Apple’s new iPhone 13 Pro models. I’d like to see it filter down to all of its products at some point. The same goes for Face ID. While that appears only in Apple’s Pro iPads right now, it’s just so convenient that I’d like to see it on the iPad Mini. Instead, Apple embedded a fingerprint reader into the power button on the side of the iPad.",error,513

While it’s unclear if Gill was behind the sales, speculation suggests he may have been unwinding his position to avoid needing a large cash outlay to exercise the options by June 21. Wall Street is closely monitoring Gill’s actions due to their potential impact on GameStop’s stock price. China EV tariffs The European Union will impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports from July 4, citing unfair subsidies and a threat to European EV producers. The additional tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 38.1%, are a result of an EU investigation that found Chinese EV companies benefit from unfair subsidies. China’s Ministry of Commerce criticized the EU decision as protectionist and lacking factual basis. The EU stated these tariffs are provisional and definitive measures will be in place within four months.  [PRO] Resilient stocksDespite mounting consumer challenges and a 3.3% inflation rate, Goldman Sachs remains optimistic about these select stocks that could benefit from continued wage growth. The Wall Street bank highlights six promising companies with low prices, unique growth drivers and robust revenue streams. Despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates and forecasting only one cut for the remainder of 2024, Lazard’s chief market strategist Ronald Temple anticipates further reductions. He advises investors, “Don’t take too much direction from today’s FOMC ‘dot plot.’ As upcoming inflation and labor reports confirm easing price pressures and labor market tightness, I expect FOMC members to reassess their forecasts to include more rate cuts by year-end.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed Temple’s sentiment, saying May’s strong jobs data might be slightly “overstated,” indicating revisions could be on the way. ”...There’s an argument that they may be a bit overstated, but still, they’re strong,” Powell said, referring to U.S. payroll reports. “We see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward better balance.” With the Fed and inflation data out of the way, the next big event for investors is whether shareholders will approve Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay deal today. The problem for Musk, even if he gets his way, is that he’s facing numerous lawsuits. Many large investors who, back in 2018, voted against the compensation package have said they’ll do the same again. CalPERS,  CalST",error,513
856," out about alleged anticompetitive behavior and Apple’s fees for developers on digital products purchased through its platform. That included threats of removing Spotify’s app, refusing to promote it, or waiting for months for minor app updates to be approved, he said. “They’ve basically thrown the book at us in order to make it hard for us to continue to sustain our decision to speak up,” he said. Many app makers have complained about the fees gatekeepers charge for in-app purchases for digital services. Gutierrez complained of what he called Apple’s “gag order” over how Spotify can communicate with its own users about how to upgrade to its paid version. For instance, Spotify allows customers to upgrade only outside of its iOS app in order to avoid Apple’s 15% to 30% commission fee on digital services purchased through its platform. But because Spotify doesn’t sell the paid service through its iOS app, Apple also doesn’t let the app maker talk about upgrades with customers through the app — instead, users have to upgrade through a web browser on a PC or another method. At the same time, Apple operates a competing service, Apple Music, which has no such restrictions. Gutierrez said this gives Apple’s version an unfair advantage. Representatives from Apple and Google both told lawmakers that their fees for developers are meant to cover the costs that go into distributing apps through their platforms and securing them appropriately. Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer compared the services offered on the App Store today to the cumbersome and expensive process app makers had to pursue to distribute their apps before the App Store existed. White cast the group as a set of “small but vocal” representatives of “primarily large companies.” He said he worried that in trying to satisfy their complaints, “we damage the very foundation that has allowed the Android open source ecosystem to work so well for a much larger set of small and medium-sized businesses.” In addition to complaints about fees, developers worried that Apple’s own rival products incentivized it to make unfavorable decisions toward them. For example, Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru said the company had asked Apple for permission to use ultra-wideband technology on iPhones to make its item-tracking technology more precise than it can be using only Bluetooth. She said Apple had refused the request, then reserved the technology for its own competitive AirTags, which it announced Tuesday. While Apple is rolling out a",error,513

Apple’s most immediate challenge in the U.S. has come from private companies bringing antitrust charges against its business in court. The most notable of these lawsuits is from Fortnite-maker Epic Games, which is set to begin its trial on Monday. Epic filed its lawsuit with a PR blitz after challenging Apple’s in-app payment fee by advertising in its app an alternative, cheaper way to buy character outfits from Epic directly, violating Apple’s rules. That prompted Apple to remove Fortnite from its App Store. Epic filed the suit shortly after and Apple filed counterclaims against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract. “Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store,” Apple said in a filing with the District Court for the Northern District of California in September. Just last week, several app-makers testified before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust about the alleged anti-competitive harms they’ve faced from restrictions on both Apple and Google’s app stores. Representatives from Apple and Google told lawmakers they simply charge for the technology and the work they put into running the app stores, which have significantly lowered distribution costs for app developers over the years. But witnesses from Tinder-owner Match Group, item-tracking device-maker Tile and Spotify painted a different picture. “We’re all afraid,” Match Group chief legal officer Jared Sine testified of the platforms’ broad power over their businesses. The witnesses discussed the seemingly arbitrary nature by which Apple allegedly enforces its App Store rules. Spotify’s legal chief claimed Apple has threatened retaliation on numerous occasions and Tile’s top lawyer said Apple denied access to a key feature that would improve their object-tracking product, before utilizing it for Apple’s own rival gadget, called AirTag. Tile said that while Apple now makes the feature available for third-party developers to incorporate, accessing it would mean handing over a significant amount of data and control to Apple. Apple’s representative said its product is different from Tile’s and opening the feature in question will encourage further competition in the space. Senators at the hearing seemed receptive to the app developers’ complaints, which",error,513
859," would simply serve to remove and obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” Craig Federighi, Apple software senior vice president, wrote in 2013. In 2016, a customer emailed Apple saying that iMessage amounts to “serious lock-in.” As part of an internal conversation about that email, Apple’s current head of marketing, Greg Joswiak, wrote to colleagues, “we hear this a lot.” Most recently, Federighi wrote to Cook about Apple’s sign-in feature which enables users to log into apps with an Apple login, saying that the feature is likely to “make our platform more sticky” in 2019. Epic also argued that Apple doesn’t need the App Store approval process to keep iPhone users safe. Epic contended that because Apple has sometimes approved low-quality apps for the store, its approval process is ineffective and doesn’t protect user security. In an email produced as part of proceedings, former Apple marketing boss Phil Schiller wrote in 2012 “Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!” in response to a report of an “obvious rip off” app becoming the top free app on Apple’s platform. In Apple’s opening statement, it emphasized that its rules have helped created a vibrant ecosystem that benefits iPhone developers, with more than 1.8 million apps in the App Store. Apple said that Epic made $750 million from the App Store, arguing that the trial is merely about money and that Epic planned this lawsuit and a related marketing campaign in order to use Apple’s technology without paying. Apple also said that Epic was looking at the wrong market and cannot show anti-competitive conduct in the gaming market — users can switch to Android, Microsoft Xbox or Sony Playstation. Apple also defended its “walled garden” without using those terms, citing its App Review department that manually reviews and approves apps and filters out “obviously malicious apps.” It said that based on its research, iOS represents only 2% of malware infections among all computing platforms. “Take away from the security particular to the iPhones and the bad actors have a field day. This is why Android security statistics are so much worse,” Dunn said. “We thought about the fact that the iPhone is a phone that you’re carrying around, you need it to work for you as a phone, and we cared deeply about the security of that device",error,513
861," about the test and updated their bosses about Netflix’s plans as Apple tried to schedule an executive meeting, according to the emails. By July 2018 Apple employees had created a presentation about the Netflix issue. The slide deck included “pie in the sky ideas” which had not been approved, an Apple employee warned. The slide deck said that Apple had already offered Netflix “custom APIs,” or non-public software to allow it to build systems to modify Apple subscriptions, handle free trials or extend auto-renew dates. It also would build features based directly on Netflix requests. It also pointed out the power of Apple’s App Store content, which can drive downloads. It ran its own tests and found that when it promoted Netflix inside its App Store app, download conversions increased by 6% to 7% and said that Netflix got more App Store placements than any other partner, driving 330,000 downloads, or a 2% conversion rate. Apple does not charge for App Store “editorial” content placements. Finally, the slide deck suggested that Apple could deepen its partnership with Netflix, including using Netflix’s commission that Apple collects to buy App Store search ads to drive downloads or bundling Netflix along with Apple services. Another possibility was to offer “video partner program benefits” to Netflix, which sounds similar to a deal Apple has with Amazon Prime Video that allows it to charge customers directly. Despite Apple’s apparent efforts, Netflix discontinued new subscriptions through Apple in December 2018, allowing it to bypass Apple’s cut on in-app purchases. The Netflix iPhone app currently opens up to the message: “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle.” Facebook has had a long conflict with Apple over its desire to put social games in its apps, which conflicts with Apple rules over having collections of apps or software inside apps. Last year, Facebook ramped up its criticism and said that Apple uses its control over its platform to harm developers and consumers. In one 2011 email exchange posted in a document repository as part of the trial and subsequently removed, Apple executives including former CEO Steve Jobs discussed a compromise over games in the Facebook iPad app after former software chief Scott Forstall talked to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The documents don’t show the terms of the compromise. However, when the Facebook iPad app came out in 2011, it included web-based games such as Farmville — bending Apple’s",error,513
861," rule against app stores on its App Store. But iPhone and iPad users couldn’t pay with Facebook’s gaming currency, Credits. Internal Facebook deliberations published as part of the Epic Games trial show how that negotiation affected company relations in the years since then. In a 2017 email filed as part of court documents, a Facebook employee attached a short analysis ahead of a Facebook executive’s meeting with Apple at Allen and Company’s annual business conference in Sun Valley. By then, Facebook wanted clarification or guidance about how to develop “instant games” inside its Facebook Messenger app, which had been slowed by Apple’s review process. But the 2011 compromise still loomed large. “In late 2016 Apple approved Facebook to move forward with putting ‘Instant Games’ in Messenger and the FB Blue App,” the Facebook employee wrote. ”[Former Apple marketing chief] Phil Schiller pulled out an email from 2011 which memorialized an agreement we made allowing FB to stream HMTL5 games as long as we don’t create an app store or do in-app payments.” The outcome of the Sun Valley meeting is unclear from court documents, but by 2020 Facebook was fighting with Apple’s review process again over a standalone gaming app. After one Apple rejection in March 2020, a Facebook employee described in emails frustration with the process and said that it “comes as a surprise given that FB Gaming includes no unique functionality that hasn’t already been approved in the Games Tab inside the Facebook App.” Facebook, according to the emails, was required to go through the same appeals process as every other developer, including appealing to an Apple body called the App Review Board. However, the social media giant was able to schedule calls with Trystan Kosmynka and Bill Havlicek, leaders of Apple’s review group, and later, Ron Okamoto, who was the VP in charge of the group before he retired this year. When Facebook Gaming was eventually released in late 2020, it was clear that Facebook and Apple could not find a compromise. “Unfortunately, we had to remove gameplay functionality entirely in order to get Apple’s approval on the standalone Facebook Gaming app — meaning iOS users have an inferior experience to those using Android,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, said in a statement at the time. An email thread from 2012 shows that top Apple executives, including Schiller and Cue, were informed of",error,513
861," Microsoft’s impending launch of Microsoft Office for iPhones and iPads. Okamoto, who at the time was an Apple VP focusing on developer relations, met with Microsoft. His email to his bosses says that Apple wanted to know if Microsoft could participate in its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. (Microsoft declined, saying it wouldn’t be ready to talk about its plans yet.) Microsoft had two requests. First, it wanted Apple to let it redirect users to the Microsoft website for in-app purchases. Microsoft would handle the payment, evading Apple’s 30% charge for in-app purchases. Second, it wanted Schiller and Cue to meet with Microsoft counterparts, in particular, Kirk Koenigsbauer, who is a current Microsoft senior vice president. Schiller said yes to the meeting but poured cold water on Microsoft’s payment proposal in an email. “We run the store, we collect the revenue.” Microsoft did not end up releasing Office for the iPad until 2014, after Satya Nadella took over for Steve Ballmer as the company’s CEO. Before Apple removed Epic’s shooter game Fortnite from the App Store, it was a top-grossing app on the store, and employees from both companies worked to seal cross-promotion deals, court filings reveal. Epic provided demos at Apple launch events highlighting new technology, quotes about Apple gaming features, and heads-up about its big events and promotions inside Fortnite. In exchange, Epic Games got promotion for Fortnite through the Apple App Store as well as through other Apple media properties such as Apple Music. It also used its relationship with Apple employees to get a Fortnite ripoff kicked off the App Store. One 2019 Epic Games email includes employees talking about a 2019 concert inside the Fortnite game featuring Marshmello, a DJ. Apple wanted to partner — but only after making sure Marshmello’s mix wouldn’t have curse words — the emails say, and included a proposal for cross-promotion with Apple’s Apple Music brand, including billboards in New York and Los Angeles, digital advertising and posts from Apple’s social media accounts. Apple needed permission to use the Fortnite name in its Apple Music playlists and ads, but Epic employees were waffling. One worried that Apple was “co-opting and drafting” in Epic’s wake. Another employee pointed out the benefits to Epic Games,",error,513

That suggests that NSO Group’s software could stop working or lose the capability to target up-to-date phones as soon as Apple fixes the exploits — which it starts doing as soon as it learns of the attacks, Apple said. “Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data,” Kristic said. Apple has made security and privacy one of its key marketing strategies, arguing its control of the operating system, and the hardware that powers it, allows Apple to deliver a higher level of security and privacy than devices made by rivals. Apple said its security team is four times larger than it was five years ago and employees work to improve device security as soon as it finds new threats. Apple publishes security fixes for each software update on its website, cataloging them with industry-standard “CVE” numbers and crediting security researchers who find them. Amnesty International’s report said NSO Group’s software doesn’t stay on an iPhone when it’s rebooted, making it harder to confirm that a device has been infected. It also suggests users who are worried about being targeted may want to regularly reboot their devices. Amnesty International said it worked with international media groups to publish details about a handful of the phone numbers it found on the leaked list and the specific circumstances that led them to have been targeted by NSO software. Some American phone numbers were on the list but it’s unclear if they were hacked, the Washington Post reported. An NSO Group spokesperson said the company will investigate all claims of misuse. “We would like to emphasize that NSO sells its technologies solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments for the sole purpose of saving lives through preventing crime and terror acts. NSO does not operate the system and has no visibility to the data,” the NSO spokesperson said. Other technology companies consider NSO Group’s business unacceptable and a threat to their users’ security. Last year, Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp sued NSO Group over an alleged WhatsApp hack.

On Wednesday through Friday of last week, the S&P 500 trading volume was below its 30-day average. For the short-term trader, a rotation away from the large-cap leaders into small-cap represented by the Russell 2000, which Colas described as being “way oversold” since its torrid hot streak in early 2021, could make sense. “Small-caps went parabolic through March and April and have not worked since because they got so far ahead,” he said. That makes them, at least statistically, based on 100-day trailing returns, cheap right now. But for investors not playing the market for a quick trade, Colas says the post-earnings disappointing trades from Apple, Facebook and Microsoft shouldn’t weigh too heavily. Amazon was the outlier in actually missing revenue expectations rather than posting a big beat, making a selloff on the news a “fair” reaction, according to Colas. It’s also important to remember that the big beats from the rest of big tech were already embedded in most of the stocks as they had a strong June and July based on the market guessing right — that Q2 earnings would be stellar. “The market was bidding up the names into the quarter. The market sniffed out the surprise and they all occurred, and when you see stocks all rally into a quarterly earnings, it’s just hard to sustain that. That is ‘sell on the news’ unless there is a tremendous amount of good news and guidance,” Colas said. “That’s normal capital markets behavior.” He goes back to one important data point in assessing the strength of these companies: they have doubled their earnings power in the past two years. “Which is astounding,” he said. And that gives him more comfort in the longer-term picture. “I don’t see any change. Big tech is still the place to be.” He cited two reasons. Even as these companies have doubled earnings growth, he doesn’t think they are anywhere near peak earnings. “It’s just a much higher base to build on.” Second, these companies have definitive advantages in industries and don’t directly compete against each other in a zero-sum game i many areas of strength.",error,513
871," These companies have grown earnings so much because the pandemic changed consumption patterns, made us all even more tech-centric, and the market made a lot of money betting on that playing out exactly as it did. But now the big question for big tech isn’t about its dominance being threatened — though multiple antitrust battles loom — it is just figuring out how much more room they have to keep the earnings growth rate going higher. “Tell me what you would pay for a company with a 30% return on investment and structural growth of 10% to 15%, and can do it for a decade? What is the multiple? Is it 30 times or 40 times? I have no idea,” Colas said, “but I know it’s not 20 times.” Apple was an example from this group of concerns about price-to-earnings multiples. It lagged the rest of the tech giants for years, seen as a hardware vendor and weighed down by that market view until the services business soared through the pandemic and the $2 trillion market cap was given to the company. And again this year, it was “the one oddball laggard,” in Colas’s words, as its year-to-date return into earnings was roughly 10% versus roughly 30% for Facebook and Microsoft. Apple trailed the S&P 500, too, ahead of the earnings. One reason: it sucked so much demand forward investors are rightly concerned posting good earnings comps will get harder. But, Colas said, that might also mean it has the most room left to go up, even in the short-term as a new iPhone launches in the fall and back-to-school boosts spending on consumer tech. The broader global growth story the entire stock market is tied to isn’t a lock. In fact, amid the panic over inflation earlier this year and expectations that the 10-year Treasury yield would go higher, it did the opposite. “The market totally understood growth had peaked in Q1 and started trending down at the end of the quarter,” Colas said. The rate story was wrong, but slower economic growth is now higher up on the list of investor concerns for a U.S. market where P/E ratios are high. Big tech represents 23% of S&P 500 and that means whatever the market next decides about its lofty valuations will weigh on U.S. stocks overall. But investors don’t have",error,513
871," that many great choices globally. With the situation in China between the government and its leading companies resulting in massive losses in recent weeks, there might be trading opportunities, but emerging markets are no place to be for anything but a trade. And even if there is potential opportunity in other international plays like European financials, it is going to take time for rates to move in a direction that benefits those stocks. “What’s left? It’s U.S. and the top of the cap table,” Colas said. “That’s what you need to own. Still back to the same names.” Looking at sector weightings back to the 1970s and through the 1990s, he says there has never been a time when five companies had more weighting. “It’s just 5 names, and it’s not like when Exxon was at its peak in the S&P. That was a commodity play. These companies have huge barriers to entry and very high structural returns.” Even with those advantages, trying to figure out what their earnings power will be post-pandemic, or at least as the world transitions from the worst of the pandemic to the lingering effects, is the bigger issue for big tech. “What is a fair growth rate for 2022? That is hard,” Colas said. For Alphabet — the only among the big tech names to report last week which rose after its earnings — and for Facebook, which reiterated a prior warning of slowing revenue growth, there is the cyclical nature of advertising market to rely on, and that has not changed all that much in recent decades. Apple, though, is a harder one, because even as it has made progress moving past the iPhone story and building its services business into a huge driver of growth, so much hardware demand was pulled forward. For Amazon, Colas noted that e-commerce’s share of demand when from 17% to 24% in Q2 2020, and then back down to 20%. And every percentage point in that band has huge leverage over Amazon’s business model  — in fact, he pointed to it as a reason why Amazon had been “stuck in that band” for nine months before it rallied into earnings. From October 2020 to June of this year Amazon had bounced around but didn’t get bid up like the other names until the pre-earnings run. Year-to-date after its earnings fall, the",error,513
872," nonprofit said in a blog post. Apple’s new system has also been criticized by the company’s competitors, including Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp, which also uses end-to-end encryption for some of its messages and has faced pressure to provide more access to people’s content to prevent child exploitation. “Instead of focusing on making it easy for people to report content that’s shared with them, Apple has built software that can scan all the private photos on your phone -- even photos you haven’t shared with anyone,” WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart tweeted on Friday. He said WhatsApp won’t adopt a similar system. “That’s not privacy.” Privacy has become a core part of iPhone marketing. Apple has been public about the security architecture of its systems and is one of the most vociferous defenders of end-to-end encryption, which means it doesn’t even know the content of messages or other data stored on its servers. Most notably, in 2016, it faced off against the FBI in court to protect the integrity of its encryption systems in the investigation of a mass shooter. Apple has taken heat for this stance. Law enforcement officials around the world have pressured the company to weaken its encryption for iMessage and other software services like iCloud to investigate child exploitation or terrorism. Apple sees the new system as part of its privacy-protecting tradition: a win-win situation in which it’s protecting user privacy while eliminating illegal content. Apple also claims the system can’t be repurposed for other kinds of content. But that’s also the reason privacy advocates see the new system as a betrayal. They feel they’ve lost an ally that built computers designed to prevent — as much as possible — data leaks to governments, Apple and other businesses. Now they see, as Snowden put it, a system that compares user photos against a “secret blacklist.” That’s because of Apple’s own marketing. In 2019, it bought a giant billboard in Las Vegas during an electronics trade show with the slogan “What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.” Apple CEO Tim Cook has addressed the “chilling effect” of knowing that what’s on your device may be intercepted and reviewed by third parties. Cook said a lack of digital privacy could prompt people to censor themselves even if the person using the iPhone has done nothing wrong. “In a world without digital",error,513
874," emails to consumers who use Apple mail products and opt into “Mail Privacy Protection” will appear like they were read as soon as it was sent, meaning that information won’t be very useful for marketers.  For a company like Domino’s, email is of huge importance: The company uses email to communicate with tens of millions of customers, to update customers on where their order is, updating them about deals and offers, and more. Domino’s VP of Digital Marketing Christopher Thomas-Moore said timing, for instance, in terms of when people are opening dinnertime emails has been helpful to send the right message when people actually want it.  “We potentially lose that data,” he said. “So we maybe are going to be a little less relevant now when we’re sending you information. Because we’re not hitting those times that are most important for you.”  Thomas-Moore said there may be an evolution for the company in figuring out how to do those types of functions without all the data it may have had before. He said there are still questions across the entire industry about what the real impacts will be, and he expects it will take some time to know.  Erik Fialho, chief operating officer at LeftLane Sports, said the change makes it more difficult to  do things like A/B testing subject lines to figure out which one is most successful in getting people to open. LeftLane is a parent company of outdoor-focused adventure travel and e-commerce sub-brands. Fialho said his company already looks at other metrics outside email opens, like how many consumers click through the email, or how many are buying.  Some marketers use email open data to do “retargeting” of sorts that relies on whether someone opened an email and didn’t end up trying to make a purchase.   What email marketers are curious about is how email service providers will tweak how they do “deliverability,” or how they decide which emails make it through to your inbox, or which are doomed to the spam filter. Blasting emails at customers who continually don’t read them can hurt deliverability. “You ultimately need your email to actually get delivered to somebody’s inbox and not to their spam for them to even react,” Fialho said. “And if the email service providers don’t take into account that suddenly a",error,513
874," lot of these email marketers aren’t going to have one of their key rates to look at, of whether or not they should send an email to a customer and whether that customer is engaged or not, can be a challenge.”  It’ll also pose challenges for newsletter-based businesses. Myles Kleeger, president of customer engagement platform Braze, said companies that monetize audiences based directly in the content from emails are ones that are probably most affected by Apple’s changes, since they often charge based on open rates.  “A lot of them charge based on some of that granular detail that maybe you won’t be able to get any more,” he said.  But those companies will likely seek out other ways to drive readers to click and prove they were reading, whether it’s a survey or some “thumbs up” button to show they’re engaging somehow.  Future Plc, which has more than 180 media brands including Marie Claire and Golf Monthly, already uses metrics that rely on more first-party data, said Allison Markert, VP of B2B Advertising & Sales Operations. That’s especially important as increasingly more privacy-focused initiatives are happening in the industry. One result of all this is that marketers will likely make a bigger push to ask consumers their permission to send them emails and to continue sending them emails, and relying on explicit permission rather than implying based on open rate data.  Inundating consumers with unwanted messages could not only get consumers to unsubscribe, but if consumers are turned off enough, they could turn to Apple’s “hide my email” feature when signing up, said Nirish Parsad, marketing technologist at Tinuiti. Marketers are also grappling with a number of other privacy changes in the industry, including previous changes from Apple that gave users more transparency and control over apps that want to track them for advertising. “My first reaction [to the email announcements] was ‘Here we go again,’” said Domino’s Thomas-Moore. “There are some assumptions that are kind of floating as to what the impacts are going to be. But we’re still so early in discovery and understanding that I expect that we’ll find ourselves moving to the center point as we continue to move forward.” All of this could also mean a shift to other means of customer communication.",error,513
875," has a specific provision that protects privacy, even more than it is now. So this kind of argument is totally bogus and I think it is going to be absolutely transparent that, actually, privacy would be better protected with this legislation.” App developers have complained to Congress and in court that Apple and Google maintain a tight grip over their businesses through control of their app stores, which are the gatekeepers of access to mobile app consumers. Companies like Epic Games and Spotify have taken issue with the companies’ commissions on purchases customers make in their apps. For example, Apple would take a 15% to 30% cut of the payment a customer makes for upgrading to Spotify Premium through the iOS app. Apple has also prevented companies from advertising through its apps that customers can get lower prices by buying through a different channel so that the developer can avoid the fee. Apple and Google say that the commissions they charge from app purchases are standard for the market and that it costs money to build and run the app stores they operate. Many developers say they don’t oppose paying some fees to cover those costs, but that the current ones are unreasonably high. Developers have also launched allegations that app store operators use knowledge of their markets to compete with them. For example, Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of Apple, which has a competing music streaming service of its own. Spotify has charged that Apple “routinely rejects bug fixes and app enhancements that would improve user experience and the app’s functionality” while declining to put such “obstacles” in front of its own service. In a 2019 statement, Apple denied Spotify’s claims that it blocked its app updates, saying, “The only time we have requested adjustments is when Spotify has tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows.”  The Open App Markets Act would prohibit large app store operators from using nonpublic business information from a third-party app to compete with it. The act also would prohibit those companies from “unreasonably preferencing or ranking” its own apps or those of its business partners ahead of others. Blackburn said on “Power Lunch” that she envisions other app store choices for consumers and more innovation under the bill. She said she sees the current situation as an “opportunity cost” that keeps some developers out of the market. Under the bill, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general could take action against the platforms. Developers would also be entitled",error,513
880,"s historic action and bold leadership by South Korean lawmakers mark a monumental step in the fight for a fair app ecosystem,” a Match spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday. “We look forward to the bill being quickly signed into law and implore legislative bodies around the globe to take similar measures to protect their citizens and businesses from monopolistic gatekeepers that are restricting the internet,” they added. Regulators worldwide are focusing more on the app stores and fees that Google and Apple are charging developers — and the ruling in South Korea will likely be the first step toward greater scrutiny, according to Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. “It’s a potential watershed moment,” Ives said on CNBC’ “Street Signs Asia” on Monday ahead of the decision in Seoul. “Not necessarily for what this means in itself, but for the ripple effect as it shows that they’re not just words, but actually actions.” Ives added that while there might be monetization opportunity for others, such as telecommunication services providers, it ultimately depends on how consumers would respond. “The question is what will consumers ultimately do? Because the path of least resistance is to go through Apple and go through Google – and that’s what consumers have gotten used to,” he said. Last year, Google said it was planning to enforce a policy requiring developers that distributed software on the Google Play Store — a digital service to download apps — to use its proprietary in-app payment system. That means other payment alternatives will not be allowed. Google’s billing system takes a 30% cut for most in-app purchases, similar to what Apple does on its App Store. The move was criticized by developers and regulators scrutinized Google’s and Apple’s hold over the smartphone operating systems and the price they charge programmers who develop apps for those platforms. The majority of the world’s smartphones either run on Google’s Android operating system or on Apple’s iOS platform. Both companies have since said they would cut their commission rates for certain developers. In Apple’s case, the company said it will halve charges from 30% to 15% for software developers with less than $1 million in annual net sales on the App Store. Google said in March it would cut Google Play Store fees from 30% to 15% for the first million dollars a developer makes on the platform per year. The iPhone maker",error,513
892," by the supply chain challenges facing tech companies who rely on Asian manufacturers and Asian semiconductors, said Scott Kessler, global technology media and telecom practice lead for consulting firm Third Bridge Group. Apple said on its last earnings call that supply-chain issues held up as much as $6 billion in iPhone sales. Last week, a report that holiday demand for the iPhone 13 wasn’t quite as high as forecast pressured Apple shares. “My sense is that it will be at least as significant as [it was] in the last quarter,” Kessler said. But these are unusual times, and Apple’s a pretty unusual stock. As always, discussion of Apple’s finances begins with its cash reserves. Analysts put them at about $62 billion, down from more than $81 billion a year ago. Apple has a good bit less cash than it once did, depleted by stock buybacks, but still, as Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says, enough to run a small country. Apple also owns another $127.9 billion in liquid securities.   Then there is the company’s very consistent cash flow, now running at about $100 billion a year. About a quarter of sales now come from Apple’s services business, which is twice as profitable as hardware like iPhones and Macbook personal computers before accounting for corporate overhead and marketing costs, leading to expectations that cash flow will be at least $100 billion a year for the next decade, and probably keep rising, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.  “The market’s confidence is a pretty accurate perception of the products we see in the pipeline,” Zino said.  “It’s a massive company. It’s a mature high-margin business in iPhones and iPads, with products that are second to none. The growth drivers for the next three years are in services, and the Apple Car is out there.” Because high-margin services businesses, especially online, command higher stock-price multiples than less-profitable hardware businesses, the shift in Apple’s mix has helped its price-to-earnings multiple rise to 28 times expected profits for its fiscal year, which ends in September.  Put those two factors together and more stock buybacks are expected. Indeed, Apple has let the dividend yield on its shares drop to a little more than half of 1% — less than even two-year Treasuries now pay — to make",error,513
892," room for more buybacks, Zino said. The logic is simple: That getting a bigger share of Apple’s cash flow from a lower share count is a better deal than a dividend closer to the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. “We were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter,” Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told analysts in October. “This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares.” Apple received its latest bullish call from the market on Monday with a buy rating from KeyBanc, which cited the services business and Apple as the best bet for return on investment among mega-cap tech peers even though its valuation is high relative to history. Confidence in Apple is also boosted by a good reception for its latest release of the iPhone, iPad and other products, and anticipation that new Apple Watches will sell well. Ives forecasts that Apple will sell 40 million iPhones in the holiday season. “The valuation isn’t egregious,” Ives said. “We think Apple will be a $3 trillion market cap company in the first half of 2022.” The risk is a global, or at least a U.S., version of the story Apple faced out of China six years ago. Back then, Asian demand for iPhones dropped amid market concerns that economic growth was slowing in Asia and its near-at-hand trading partners, taking shares down with them. The episode showed Apple remains a consumer-driven company, subject to risk if consumers get ratted enough to curtail spending. No one yet knows if omicron will repeat that pattern, but Zino argues that each succeeding wave of Covid infection has hurt stocks much less than the initial one in winter and early spring 2000, and that stocks bounced back quickly from even that, thanks to strong underlying confidence in the economy. That, in turn, drives the assumption behind Apple’s star turn as the safe haven of a wary market: The idea that, if it falls, investors will eventually get their money back, while bonds, Apple’s competition for safe haven status, see their prices erode as rates for newly-issued paper rises.  “I’d much rather be in large-cap tech than in bonds, given where bond yields are and where they’re expected to go,” said Zino, who,",error,513

And Peloton is reportedly planning a digital heart rate armband.  The global market for wearable health and fitness devices — including sensor-laden watches, wrist bands, rings, skin patches, eyeglasses and clothing — reached more than $36 billion in 2020, according to Fortune Business Insights, and is projected to top $114 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.4%. Deloitte Global predicts that the market segment just for smartwatches and smart patches will ship 320 million units worldwide in 2022, a figure likely to reach 440 million by 2024. “There is significant money in this area from venture capital and private investment sources,” said Deloitte’s Paul Silverglate, vice chair and U.S. technology sector leader. Several medtech companies have introduced smart patches, penny-sized swaths that adhere to the skin and use microscopic needles that act as biosensors and deliver medications. BioIntelliSense, based in Redwood City, Calif., created the BioSticker, worn on the upper left chest for continuous monitoring and data capture of respiratory rate, heart rate at rest and skin temperature. Publicly owned Insulet, based in Acton, Massachusetts, has developed OmniPod, a patch that serves as an insulin pump. Sensorized clothing has emerged, too. Montreal-based Hexoskin developed a line of smart shirts that collect cardiac, respiratory and activity data, and transmits it to an iOS or Android compatible device. The company partnered with the Canadian Space Agency on an extraterrestrial version, Astroskin, to track astronauts’ vitals while rocketing out of this world. Beyond the technological capabilities, there is now the critical issue of efficacy — of the devices, the apps that link to them and the petabytes of data generated — which is leading wearables makers to coordinate with independent researchers to see if they deliver as advertised. Joshua Hagen, a research associate professor at The Ohio State University’s Department of Integrated Systems Engineering, was studying biosensors more than a decade ago at the Air Force Research Labs “before wearables really exploded on the scene,” he said. Hagen then started testing devices on elite athletes, monitoring their performance data. “There’s a ton of devices out there, but we have to first and foremost trust the data that�",error,513
894,"�s coming off of them,” he said. Hagen has discovered that the part of the body where a device is worn matters. The Polar heart monitor chest strap, for instance, around since the early 1980s, “has been validated a thousand different ways.” And the wrist is good for measuring resting heart rate. “But fingers are a very interesting place,” he said, referring to his studies on the Oura ring. In one, it had the second-highest accuracy among the devices, with chest straps ranking first. Another study, launched after Covid hit, found that by applying an algorithm to Oura user data, Hagen’s team could identify early warning signs three days in advance of coronavirus infection. A separate proof-of-concept study, examining the efficacy of various wearables, showed they could detect the onset of fever, a pervasive symptom of Covid and other infections. In November 2019, Apple partnered with research groups to launch three health studies using the Apple Watch. A women’s health project, in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health and the National Institutes of Health, aims to advance the understanding of menstrual cycles and their relationship to various health conditions, including infertility, osteoporosis and menopausal transition. Apple’s heart and movement study, with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the American Heart Association, is exploring how certain mobility signals and details about heart rate and rhythm could serve as potential early warning signs of atrial fibrillation, or Afib, heart disease or declining mobility. The ultimate scenario for health wearables envisions the general public donning smart devices, proven to be efficacious, that continuously download vital data to primary care providers who track patients in real-time, monitor their overall health and respond to any emergencies. To make that leap, however, physicians must be convinced that the devices work, patients use them properly and the data is reliable. Toward that goal, the American Medical Association (AMA) conducted a survey of physicians to gauge their opinions on a variety of digital health tools, including wearables. More than 87% of respondents see at least some advantage in their usage overall, especially wearables and telehealth devices. Yet physicians also said there are “must-haves” that digital tools need in order to turn their enthusiasm into adoption, including improved efficiency and increased protection of patients’ data privacy and security. “Physician enthusiasm for technology is directly tied to a",error,513
910," is a staple in sports bars that use the game package to bring in fans of nonlocal games, most of whom have no other way to watch their favorite team. Sunday Ticket is also popular with sports gamblers who want to see multiple games at the same time. DirecTV would also consider acting as a residential pass-through. Under such an agreement, it could transfer all revenue for Sunday Ticket to the rights owner but still offer it to customers. This would allow DirecTV to mitigate churn while reducing switching costs for consumers. It would also backstop any potential streaming latency or reliability issues that may come with broadcasting live football over broadband. Still, it’s unclear whether the winning bidder would be interested in such a partnership. Building a commercial relationship may be enticing for Disney, Apple or Amazon, and the winner may want to be the direct contact for all Sunday Ticket subscribers. AT&T spun out DirecTV last year. It is now a privately held independent company co-owned by AT&T and private equity firm TPG. When AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015, Sunday Ticket rights were so important that the entire $49 billion deal was contingent on renewing a long-term contract with the NFL. But fewer than 2 million subscribers usually sign up for the package each year, making Sunday Ticket a money-loser for the satellite TV provider, which no longer is interested in bidding on the full rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for DirecTV declined to comment. While Amazon has already acquired exclusive Thursday Night Football rights and Disney’s ESPN owns Monday Night Football, Apple would represent a new global partner for the NFL – with the world’s largest corporate balance sheet. That’s appealing for the NFL because it potentially brings a new bidder to the table for future deal talks. Apple has showcased its ability to broadcast live sports this year by streaming Major League Baseball games, though some fans, especially older ones, have complained about the exclusive streaming package. Apple also agreed to stream Major League Soccer games in a 10-year deal announcement earlier this month. Amazon will be the first exclusive streaming provider for NFL games when it begins carrying Thursday Night Football this year. Apple would like to own global rights for Sunday Ticket, two of the people said. The NFL hasn’t reached the phase in its discussions with Apple where it’s decided if it will give those to the company or sell them separately, one of the people said.

We like SBNY for its diversification and sub-TBV valuation.” Evercore named Meta a top pick, noting it still likes the company’s business model. “META is clearly moving to reduce a cost structure that arguably became bloated post Covid. Our checks suggest improved ad attribution is helping to recover more ad $’s, and Reels is well on its way to closing its monetization gap.” Oppenheimer said it’s standing by its outperform rating on Meta. “We are increasing our target to $235 (was $220) on higher advertising estimates as AI investments are beginning to drive improved targeting.” Goldman said the shipping giant is well positioned heading into earnings next week. “",error,513

While the bank is better positioned for potential deposit outflows on Sunday evening than it may have been earlier in the weekend, if there are net deposit outflows, it will shrink the EPS power of the bank. Therefore, we have a negative bias to our EPS estimates.” Citi downgraded the stock due to “model challenges” ahead of earnings later this month. “We proactively lower 2023 estimates below Street ahead of 4Q earnings on 3/22 due to continuing weakness in discretionary, the potential for “trade down” in pet (=share loss for Petco), and EPS dilution from higher rates.” Wells said in its upgrade of the banking giant that “goliath is winning.” “JPM epitomizes our theme of ‘Goliath is Winning’, which should benefit both offense (market share gains) and defense (more diversified) in these less certain times. We increase ests., PT, and rating to Overweight from Equal Weight.” Read more about this call here.

Wells said investors should buy the dip in shares of Eli Lilly. “We are upgrading LLY to Overweight as recent weakness creates a buying opportunity. We think fundamentals of the company remain the same, and at current levels risk / reward into donanemab Alzheimer’s trial may be skewed to the upside.” Wells said in its upgrade of the biopharma company that “weakness creates opportunity.” “We rate AMGN Overweight, as we think the company’s near-to-medium-term growth profile, including HZNP major product drivers delivering modest sales, can achieve a 6% top line and 10% bottom line CAGR from 2023 to 2026.” Evercore said it’s bullish on the medtech",error,513

The collapse of SIVB shows that cash influx in 2020/2021, rapid rate hike in 2022, asset liability mismanagement, and run on the bank are the likely actual causes. We reduce our PT of COIN from $84 to $70 to reflect revenue and ecosystem risks.” DA Davidson said it sees an attractive entry point for the regional bank. “Given PACW’s financial update largely in-line with our 1Q expectations, continued execution of the balance sheet contraction strategy, valuation of 73% of TBV, and a positive bias reflected in our recent update, we think last week’s sell-off represents a more attractive entry point for investors, particularly on the heels of Sunday’s announced Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) by the Fed.” Bank of America lowered its price target on Charles Schwab to $60 per share from $74 and said it’s concerned about rising rates. “The significant rise in short-term interest rates over the last 12 months is creating major issues in financial services as the cost (rising) and duration (shrinking) of liabilities are now changing rapidly, which is putting capital intensive financial institutions with long-term assets in difficult situations.” Mizuho said its bullish on Meta management’s recent moves. “We applaud the company’s efforts to drive further efficiency during economic uncertainty, and FY23E consensus implies Reality Labs to incur expenses at 12% of revenues in FY23 (or $14bn), so the capacity for cost optimization is meaningful.” Bank of America said it’s bullish on Alphabet’s entry into AI. “However, we continue to see strong data",error,513

917,"’m allowed to say.” Apple’s secrecy can be tied to its founder, Steve Jobs, who insisted on it. Jobs was a master marketer who perfected the product launch as spectacle, often relying on surprises to keep the show going when discussing new products. Today, Apple still relies on “surprise and delight” during product launches, which remain a key marketing strategy — Apple held three separate launch livestreams this fall to release new Apple Watches, iPhones and Mac laptops. All three presentations drew millions of viewers, who tuned into YouTube to hear directly from Apple executives about its new products. Apple considers details about unreleased products to be a “one of its greatest assets.” In Apple’s business conduct policy from October, it says employees should be “very selective” when disclosing Apple business information to vendors or suppliers, and they should only do so after a nondisclosure agreement is in place. The handbook also says suppliers should follow Apple principles such as confidentiality. “When there is a business need to share confidential information with a supplier, vendor, or other third party, never volunteer more than what is necessary to address the business at hand,” according to the policy. “Any confidential information shared outside Apple should be covered by a non disclosure/confidentiality agreement.” Even with layers of NDAs and a limited ability to publicize a customer win, many suppliers jump at the opportunity to sell to Apple. Cirrus Logic, a maker of audio chips, said in an SEC filing in March that Apple accounted for 81% of its total sales in fiscal 2020, which were $1.28 billion. Still, Cirrus executives rarely say Apple’s name, and for years they avoided it entirely. In 2017, an investor presentation included a slide with a variety of logos of their customers. Apple’s logo was nowhere to be found. Instead, the Cirrus slide included a picture of a brown box with the words ”#1 CUSTOMER.” Recent investor slide decks simply say that Cirrus Logic supplies the top seven smartphone makers. “Before we begin the Q&A, I’d also like to note that while we understand this intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship,” Cirrus Logic President John Forsyth said on a conference call with analysts in November, as the company regularly says before discussing its own",error,513
920," across the hallway, there isn’t enough hangar space to fly the private jets in from California.” On Tuesday, discussion of the legislation focused on Apple, which the senators tended to avoid naming due to decorum rules, instead referring to it as a “technology company” or, as North Dakota state senator Randy Burckhard said, “the same fruit Adam and Eve were not asked to eat.” “North Dakota is not the place to settle a dispute between companies on what the commission rates or payment systems should be,” Jerry Klein, a state senator who opposed the bill, said. Last year, Epic Games, the gaming company that makes the popular shooter Fortnite, filed antitrust lawsuits against Apple and Google that are currently working through the courts, focusing on many of the same issues, including alternative app stores and giving software makers the option to use their own payment processor. Epic Games is part of an effort called Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), which includes software companies like Spotify, Match Group and 50 other companies that have chafed under Apple’s control of its App Store. The Coalition for App Fairness has lobbied around the North Dakota bill, a spokesman for the coalition said on Tuesday. A North Dakota lobbyist who worked on the bill represents Epic Games, Match Group and the Coalition for App Fairness, and helped Epic Games contribute testimony, Tera Randall, Epic’s VP of communications and policy, said in an email. “The Coalition for App Fairness wants to see urgent changes to the App Store and is supportive of policy solutions at the state, federal, and international levels,” CAF executive director Meghan DiMuzio said in a statement. The New York Times first reported Epic Games’ lobbying around the bill on Tuesday. Match Group declined to comment. Epic Games pointed to Randall’s testimony last week. “The anticompetitive practices on mobile platforms today stifle innovation and subject mobile developers to crippling restrictions. This hurts consumers by reducing choice and inflating prices,” Randall testified last week. In October, the House Judiciary Subcommittee said in a report that Apple’s “monopoly power” over iPhone apps gives it outsized profits. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against Apple in a case that opened up the possibility of consumer lawsuits against Apple’s app store for allegedly inflating app prices. Last year, Apple introduced a new program that reduced its fee for",error,513
947," on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you’re just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you’re gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it’ll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother. It’s one of those things you need to see for yourself to appreciate. Battery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you’re playing games for hours and hours, iPhone 13 Pro Max should get you to bedtime and even into another day. That’s thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left. Apple promises up to 25 hours of streaming video playback, but I imagine I took a bit of a hit since I was streaming instead of playing a downloaded video, and used the phone for other things. Speaking of movies, the screen also gets brighter than last year’s model, although I find the iPhone 12 Pro Max already gets plenty bright. Apple also updated the cameras. The regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they’re better at taking pictures in the dark. The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone. Here’s a shot of my dog Mabel: The new macro camera option is a lot of fun. You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail. Apple also increased the zoom range a bit, offering 3x zoom instead of 2.5x on last year’s Pro models. I took pictures of turtles in the park to test this, but found I still had to get pretty close, even with 3x zoom, for the shot I wanted. But I got close enough without scaring them off. (Still, Samsung’s phones, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, have way better zoom.) There are some other camera options that people who do a lot of filming will use more than I did. Cinematic Mode lets you keep",error,513
947," a subject in focus and then automatically switch to another. So if you’re filming someone talking, the way you might for a movie, you can keep them in focus and keep the other person in the background blurred, then switch the focus when the second person begins talking. I mostly film my son toddling around the living room so I don’t really use these features. Apple’s pro customers may, although this option is limited to shooting in HD and isn’t available in 4K. There’s a ton of space to store all your stuff, too. Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max can be configured with up to 1TB of storage for $500 on top of the base price. Just for comparison’s sake, that’s four times as much storage as my MacBook Air and twice as much as the maximum storage option last year. Most people don’t need this much, but pro users storing lots of 4K video may find it useful. Like last year, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is durable. It’s water-resistant, so it can survive being dropped in a pool, just like Apple’s other iPhones, but also has the same strong glass and steel on the front and back as the iPhone 13 Pro and last year’s Pro models. Having owned last year’s model, I know it can take a pretty solid beating. The screen still gets scratched as easily as usual, though. It’s huge. And it’s heavier than last year. I loved big-screen phones when I was traveling more often. But now that I’m at home, I prefer a smaller phone — I turn to an iPad for movies. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is awkward to use in bed when you’re trying to hold it with one hand. It’s also too big and heavy for me to tuck into my running belt. And I’ve dropped my iPhone 12 Pro Max countless times trying to fumble with it and something else. The ProMotion display mostly works well, but I noticed some hiccups in apps like Spotify, where some menu options appeared to rise slightly slower from the bottom of the screen instead of appearing instantaneously. Most people might not even notice that. And GIFs in a chat app I used played in slow motion. Those bugs will probably get fixed as apps optimize for the new screens.  I’d also like to see Apple improve other",error,513
947," areas. The phone could use USB-C charging so that I could carry one cable to charge my Mac, iPad and phone. Instead, the iPhone uses the aging Lightning port. I’d also like to see other fun features you get on Android, like reverse wireless charging. It would be useful if I could just drop my AirPods on the back of the iPhone to charge them up. But Apple would need to perfect this: It’s not power-efficient on Android phones — you often lose more battery life than you’re giving to the gadget you’re charging — and can be too slow to even bother with. All the iPhone 13 models have 5G, but there’s little reason to upgrade for that right now. Most of us are still at home where we have Wi-Fi and it’s unclear when we’ll be out in the real world more often. When we are, you’ll be able to take advantage of 5G for faster downloads or for things like streaming games. But that’s not really a reason to upgrade at this point. The iPhone 13 Pro, which starts at $999, is effectively the same phone as the iPhone 13 Pro Max, with slightly less battery life and a smaller 6.1-inch screen. You still get the fancy high-refresh-rate display, and the cameras are exactly the same. (Unlike the case with last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max, which had better cameras than the plain old Pro.) The battery life is a little worse but still solid. In my tests, I used it with the screen on for six hours, watching a movie three times on repeat and using it for other things, and still had 28% battery left. Most people should be fine getting through a full day. If you’re interested in the most advanced phone technology from Apple but don’t want an enormous screen, get this version. The iPhone 13, which starts at $799, is a solid phone, but lacks the most advanced features found in the Pro models. Here are the main differences: Still, Apple made a lot of upgrades between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, like adding twice the storage (128GB) on the entry-level model, new cameras, improved battery life, an updated processor, brighter screens and 5G support in more countries. The cameras in particular were upgraded from the iPhone 12 for improved night pictures and better HDR (shots when it’s really",error,513
950," which battled with Carl Icahn, went private, and then IPO’d again — has seen its shares rise over 200% since the pandemic began, and Dell says the strength of demand will continue, despite the semiconductor shortages. Last quarter’s sales growth of 15% was the highest since Dell’s re-emergence on the public markets in 2018. “I think we will have a very strong second half,” Dell said. “The demand for our products across the board is super strong.” During the pandemic period, which is nearing two years, Dell noted that lockdowns made organizations all over the world invest heavily in technology. The introduction on Tuesday of Windows 11 will continue a major demand cycle in PCs, with “700 million PCs out there that won’t run Windows 11, so there is an enormous upgrade cycle,” Dell said. At a CNBC Technology Executive Council event last Thursday, semiconductor CEO Matt Murphy of Marvell Technology noted that companies, including his own, are having trouble finding enough computers to buy for their employees amid a technology demand curve that is unprecedented. Dell, who will speak on Oct. 13 at CNBC’s @Work Summit, said hybrid work has generated a lot of demand and has been a “big tailwind” for the company. “Through this last 18 months we all sort of learned work is something we do, it’s not a place,” Dell said. “Employers are embracing hybrid work and creating a lot of demand for technology and ultimately leading to happier employees and more productivity. It doesn’t mean there is not a role for offices, but it will definitely be different in the future and this period has given us a real glimpse of the future in terms of how we can use technology and tools to work from anywhere.” Demand related to cloud infrastructure, edge computing, 5G and cybersecurity have also contributed to sales growth. “All of those are generating demand... demand is strong, and while there are supply chain challenges, we are doing relatively well,” he said. The supply chain issues have impacted Dell, which has been doing “lots of forward buying,” he said. But he added, “We do have very high backlogs even though we are shipping more products than we ever have in the past, and lead times for many products are extended.” Dell doesn’t see the supply chain issues",error,513
957," slots and faster Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max processors. They also have three Thunderbolt 4 ports for adding things like external monitors and other accessories. Apple brought back MagSafe this year, the popular magnetic charger that it ditched after the 2017 MacBook Air. I like it because it helps charge the MacBook Pro up to 50% in just 30 minutes. It also pulls out if you trip on the cord so the whole MacBook doesn’t come crashing down. You can still use the Thunderbolt ports to charge with a USB-C power adapter if you want to. That new 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display might be my favorite feature of all. Professionals will probably appreciate the main reason it exists: so you can color grade really sharp HDR videos and photos accurately. But I like it because it’s incredibly bright. I don’t often drop numbers in reviews because they don’t mean much to most people, but they’re easiest to explain this. The 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro has 500 nits of brightness while the MacBook Air has 400 nits. The new 14-inch MacBook Pro, by comparison, has 1,000 nits of brightness but can hit 1,600 nits thanks to the new mini-LED backlighting, which allows certain areas of the display to get super bright for movies or photos. The screen has a million-to-one contrast ratio, too, which means really deep blacks and bright whites. The sharp resolution combined, rich colors, high brightness and large contrast ratio give you picture quality that’s better than some high-end HDTVs. For normal folks like me, that means colors really pop in movies and TV shows, and even my photos snapped with HDR on my iPhone 13 look the way they do on my iPhone screen, which also supports HDR. It’s just a huge difference from my M1 MacBook Air. I also appreciate the addition of ProMotion, which makes scrolling smoother. That’s a feature that’s on Apple’s new iPhone 13 Pro models and the iPad Pros, too, and it makes a difference when you’re scrolling through a news story. And it adjusts on the fly to save battery life if you’re not scrolling or doing something that requires that high refresh rate. But you can turn it off or select a specific rate if you’re a video editor who needs a specific refresh rate.  The speakers are way better than any other",error,513
957," laptop speaker I’ve tested. They have a noticeably rich bass and can fill a room with audio. They support spatial audio, too, which is like surround sound if you’re playing movies or music encoded with Dolby Atmos. It makes a movie or music sound like it’s coming from all around instead of just from the left or right of the laptop. The keyboard works just as well as the last-generation model, which received a big update after Apple’s Butterfly keyboards caused all sorts of issues, from sticky keys to repetitive keystrokes. It feels just as easy to type on as my M1 MacBook Air. I like that Apple got rid of the Touch Bar screen up top, which I didn’t really find useful on earlier MacBook Pro models, and instead replaced it with full-sized function keys that are easy to tap to adjust the volume, screen brightness and more.  Then there’s the new M1 Pro chip. It’s way more powerful than what I need in a laptop, which is why it’s really marketed toward professionals. I tested out some demos where I was able to test six iOS apps running side by side in Xcode, like a developer might if they were trying to see how well their new app ran on different models of iPhones. You can edit multiple 8K HDR video scenes (or Apple’s brighter XDR content) in real time within apps like Final Cut Pro, or render and tweak how the sun falls on 3D models in Cinema 4D, all without waiting for the computer to render. Professionals will likely appreciate being able to do these tasks from a laptop with a screen and processors that enable them to. Lastly, you can add up to two additional displays with the M1 Pro or three screens if you upgrade to the M1 Max chip. That’s up from a single external monitor with the M1 chips last year, and it’s a big deal for folks like me who prefer to run several screens at once. Back to something everyone can appreciate: there’s a 1080p webcam. Apple is finally moving on from the 720p camera on earlier models. That actually improved a lot last year thanks to the M1 chip, which used software to boost the quality. But the sharper resolution this year is noticeable, and you’ll finally look clear in video chats. I just wish Apple found a way to add its Center Stage feature, which tracks you as you move",error,513
957," around on iPads, to its laptop. The studio mics also help you sound clear. Finally, the battery life is good considering all the power you get. Apple promises up to 17 hours of battery life for HD video playback with the screen at eight notches of brightness, and I got close to that in my video playback tests, losing about 23% of battery life every four hours of video playback. Of course, your mileage is going to vary. Video rendering will cut that down, for example. But anyone who needs this for web browsing and document editing should get through a workday just fine. There’s a notch for the webcam in the top of the display. People are going to have strong opinions about it. I don’t mind it in most situations. You won’t notice it if you have the laptop on dark mode, which is what I did, since everything around the notch is dark anyway. And I prefer the trade-off: you get slimmer bezels on the top of the screen instead of big borders like on earlier models. You’ll see the notch if you have a bright background and menus but it fades into the background even better than it does on an iPhone, where it cuts into video content, for example. But, I wish the notch also had Face ID, the facial recognition feature that unlocks iPhones and some iPad models. I’m fine with the Touch ID fingerprint reader since it’s what I’ve been used to on other Macs. Face ID would allow the laptop to boot right to your desktop in a split second as you sit down, though. And some Windows laptops, like Microsoft’s Surface products, have a similar facial recognition option with Windows Hello. Also, all that power comes with a small trade-off. It’s a bit heavier than I expected at 3.5 pounds. It’s not too heavy, but more so than the 2.8-pound MacBook Air and a half pound heavier than last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a nearly perfect combination of power and portability. Though everyone will appreciate the amazing screen, great speakers, fast charging and improved webcam, this laptop is best suited for professionals who need all of the ports, added power and display tech that aren’t available in Apple’s other laptops. The M1 MacBook Air is still the laptop for most people, and it costs $1,000 less",error,513
958,". We all have different-sized ears. They stayed in my ears while running and riding on my exercise bike. They’re resistant against rain and sweat, so you shouldn’t have to worry too much about them if they get wet. And they sound way better, too, with nice rich deep bass and balanced audio. When it was quiet at home, I often thought that I was still wearing my $249 AirPods Pro. The sound is really similar, they just lack the noise-canceling in the AirPods Pro. The microphones also worked well during a few test calls with friends and colleagues. I was told I sounded clear. The AirPods 3 support Spatial Audio like the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. This can be really cool. If you’re speaking to multiple people on a FaceTime call, and one person is on the left of the screen and another is on the right, their voices will sound like they’re coming from the right and left into your earbuds. Also, if you’re watching a movie on your Mac, Apple TV, iPad or iPhone, it’ll sound like the audio is coming from that device, instead of just in stereo. It’s a wild effect and pretty fun. You can always turn it off if you don’t like it. The AirPods 3 case design is still compact, though it’s more rectangular (and smaller) than the AirPods Pro case. I like that the case supports wireless charging and adds magnets so that it easily attaches to a MagSafe charger, which you might have for your iPhone 12 or iPhone 13. Apple lets you customize the AirPods case with your name, emoji, text and other things for free. On Tuesday, it will start doing that in stores for the first time, beginning with the Apple Fifth Avenue location in New York. Apple said it takes about 10 minutes. The battery life is really good. Apple promises six hours of music before you have to return the AirPods to the case for another charge, and that’s close to what I was getting. It also says about four hours of talk time for calls. The case provides a total of 30 hours of charging. By comparison, the AirPods Pro have 4.5 hours of audio time before they need to be charged while the second-generation AirPods have five hours of listening time.  The third-generation AirPods",error,513
958," have a small skin sensor inside that can detect when they’re in your ears. Apple says it’s more accurate than the proximity sensors in its other AirPods, so they should more reliably automatically turn off when they’re placed on a desk or not in your ears. The AirPods 3 support Find My, the same way the AirPods Pro and Max do. So, if you lose the case, or even a single bud, you can open the Find My app on your iPhone or Mac or iPad and it’ll help direct you to them if they’re within range. It worked well. They operate well with other Apple products. If you own an iPhone, a Mac, a Watch and an iPad, you can just plug in the AirPods and play music on that gadget and it’ll come right through to the AirPods. I love that I don’t have to pair them with every other Apple gadget. There’s no noise cancelation. These are an open design, which means Apple isn’t trying to seal outside noise, and it makes and sells these for people who prefer that option. Still, $179 is more than some headphones that include noise-canceling, even if those cheaper options don’t sound as good. And there are times when you might want noise-canceling. I prefer it for when I’m on the exercise bike, for example, because it gets really loud while I’m chugging along trying to climb hills. With the AirPods Pro, I can drown out the bike noise and focus on the music. I didn’t find this as much of an issue on runs, though, since I like to hear the world around me. And the design of the AirPods 3 still helped block wind noise. I think these would be better looking if Apple could just get rid of the stems altogether, but they serve a purpose. The microphone is at the bottom, closer to your mouth. (It’s where the battery was in the first generation, too.) And extending the design in this way also helps cut down on the bulk of the AirPod in your ear.  The AirPods 3 are the best AirPods for most people right now. The sound is excellent, they’re comfortable, the battery life is great and the case has wireless charging. But, if you want noise-cancellation,",error,513
968,"s what these products do for people.” Rhind says the adoption rate is especially high among a very specific type of sophisticated investor — someone who trades actively and is comfortable taking risks, especially when grappling with amplified gains and losses. But with calls for more disclosure, Wall Street watchdogs like Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC have been cracking down on overly complex products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has already voiced concerns over leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products — saying they can pose risks even to sophisticated investors and “potentially create systemwide risk by operating in unanticipated ways” — especially when the markets are volatile or under stress. Regulatory and trading risks So, what are the odds the SEC gives these products the green light? That’s tough to say, but Rhind notes that the structure of these products has been around for many years — and that investors have so far proven to be very comfortable with the way they work. Still, Dave Nadig, financial futurist at ETF Trends, says it’s important to recognize the potential risks of contagion from trading such levered products. “Imagine there being six, seven, eight, different ETFs, all pegged, say, against Amazon,” Nadig said. “Does the Robinhood investor understand in a world where we’ve got six or seven of these levers, or inverse plays on every major security in the market? That’s where it starts to get a little bit confusing.” Mazza agreed there is a risk but reiterated that such ETFs should not be treated as buy-and-hold investments. He also said he does not foresee any systemic risk stemming from these products in the broader market. “The ETF structure has proved to be resilient,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we really advocate for traders to understand how these work, particularly around that daily reset mechanism.” He noted that the implied holding period for these products is extremely short, “so for the most part, folks are using them appropriately.” Rhind added that the ETFs he’s looking to launch provide a safer way to do leverage than a lot of traditional methods of shorting — because traders will never lose more than their initial investment.

She also said that within the electronics business, inability to get raw materials from China forced some factories to run at lower rates, affecting margin in the second quarter. The company expects revenue of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in the second quarter, slightly below the $3.33 billion forecast by FactSet. Earnings per share of 70 cents to 80 cents in the second quarter is also below FactSet’s estimated 84 cents a share. Full-year guidance for the year ending in December remained in line with FactSet expectations. Despite a strong fiscal third quarter, makeup company Estee Lauder cut its full-year outlook due to Covid controls in China and inflation. “The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many Chinese provinces led to restrictions late in the fiscal 2022 third quarter to prevent further spread of the virus,” the company said in a release Tuesday.

988," Tracking Transparency prompts from Apple because we don’t track users.” For years, many of the apps that have topped Apple’s App Store charts have been supercharged by a marketing strategy designed to target users who are most likely to spend. Companies such as Facebook, Google, and TikTok sell app install ads. They usually show up within other apps as a pop-up or an item inside a feed. When users click on the ad, they’re brought to a page in the App Store to download the advertised app. App install ads are a core part of the user acquisition strategy for many companies, especially e-commerce companies and casual games that rely on getting a small fraction of users to buy lots of add-ons within the game. These users are sometimes known as “whales.” An estimate from AppsFlyer, which makes advertising software for app makers, said app makers will spend $96.5 billion on app install ads in 2021, or about a third of total mobile spending on ads.  That’s because they’re effective. Sensor Tower, an analytics firm monitoring app stores, published a study on Thursday finding that referrals from other apps drove 20% of new app installs on the App Store in 2020. The only larger source was direct searches on the App Store, which accounted for 59% of installs. App install ads are often sold by price-per-install, ranging from pennies to tens of dollars. Typically, the ad buyers will estimate how much a customer in a given demographic might spend throughout their time using the app and make a simple mathematical judgment. If the price-per-install is less than the estimated lifetime value of the people those ads are targeting, then the app maker buys as many of those ads as it can afford. The ATT change, and other Apple privacy tweaks, threaten this model by drastically reducing the amount of information that marketers have about how effective their ads are. Without that information, app marketers can’t tell if they are getting the right people to install their apps. “When you look at the companies who are investing $6 [million] to $20 million a month, every month for 18 months to get a payback, all that stuff becomes opaque very, very quickly, when Apple flips that switch,” Bowman said. Casual gaming apps, which often appear on Apple’s Top Grossing charts, are most likely to be hurt. Games are a huge part of Apple’s App Store",error,513
988," business, representing 65.8% of spending on the platform, according to a Sensor Tower estimate. For games, referrals are the top source for downloads, driving 38% of first-time installs in 2020 — more than people directly searching through the App Store, according to Sensor Tower. “The primary growth strategy for most, if not all, mobile gaming companies is paid ads. There aren’t really any gaming companies that don’t utilize them,” said Eric Seufert, the author of Mobile Dev Memo, who has a background in user acquisition for gaming companies. Unity, a company that makes gaming and advertising software for small developers to build on, warned in February that the IDFA change could change the “way mobile game developers acquire customers and how they optimize lifetime customer value.” Andre Kempe of Admiral Media, a marketing firm focused on mobile app publishers, believes that Apple’s change could force gamemakers to change the way their games work. Instead of relying on a few huge spenders, they might have to target larger numbers of people to spend smaller amounts. “Once they realize, okay, I need to make money with this, then some product manager would say, okay, we need to put a payment screen somewhere in the first level, which you haven’t seen before, so the user experience will change a little bit,” said Kempe. There are more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store, and app marketers say that apps can’t rely on hoping people discover them on the App Store, or waiting around for Apple to feature them. “It’s the tyranny of over-choice, because you go in there, and you can access and download anything for the most part on the free-to-play side, from a game perspective,” said T.S. Kelly, head of analytics at Carat, a media agency. Apple prefers to promote elegant, beautiful apps inside the App Store that fit with its brand image — not the casual games that are skilled at advertising. “If Apple hurts advertising and makes it much less efficient, then developers do become more dependent on Apple for exposure,” Seufert said. But there is a way to pay for better placement in the App Store: Search ads. Although tiny compared with Apple’s App Store revenue, which hit an estimated $21.7 billion last year according to Sensor Tower, its ads business is growing. In",error,513
994," last decade: Apple generally takes a 30% cut of digital transactions within apps and sales of paid apps themselves. Developers in Epic’s camp say the so-called “Apple tax” gives Apple too much leverage since it only allows users to download software from its own store. Apple does not allow alternative app stores like Google does on Android. Large app makers such as Spotify and dating company Match Group support Epic’s lawsuit. Many of these developers also formed a group called the Coalition for App Fairness, which has recently pushed state legislatures in Arizona and North Dakota to pass laws reining in Apple’s control of the App Store. If Apple loses the court battle or is forced to make concessions to Epic and other app developers, it could slow down growth in Apple’s App Store revenue. (The App Store generated about $64 billion in gross sales in 2020, up from about $50 billion in 2019.) Apple has said it collects the fees in part to maintain the safety and security of the App Store so its customers can feel confident in the software they download. The company recently changed its fee structure so that it will only take a 15% cut from apps that generate less than $1 million in a year. Apple’s control over the App Store was also the key focus of a congressional antitrust report last year that found Apple uses its control “to create and enforce barriers to competition and discriminate against and exclude rivals while preferencing its own offerings.” Apple denied the findings of the report and said its fees are in line with other digital software stores. In addition to the legislation in Arizona and North Dakota, regulators in the U.S. are reportedly probing Apple for a formal antitrust complaint. Apple’s dependence on China is a vulnerability rivals could exploit. Most of Apple’s products, including the iPhone, are assembled in China before they’re shipped to customers around the world. While Apple has a small manufacturing presence in the U.S., most of it happens in China. Apple’s reliance on supply chains and assembly in the country is something rivals might point to amid rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. And it’s already happening. Earlier this month, Peter Thiel, a billionaire tech investor and Facebook board member, said Apple is less likely to confront China because of its deep ties in the country. He also had similar criticism about Google’s efforts in China. ″Apple is probably the one that’s struct",error,513
996," into an iCloud account on an iPhone. The Find My network can be used to find an iPhone after it’s been shut off, as thieves often do after stealing a phone. (If the device is on, it can be contacted through Find My iPhone, a similar service that uses the device’s internet connection and predates the Find My network.) Users can also opt out of the Find My network in Apple’s settings, although that means they don’t get the benefits of the network, such as finding devices that have been turned off or aren’t connected to cellular or Bluetooth. (To do so, go to Settings > Your Name > Find My > Find My iPhone > and then toggle “Find My network” on or off.) The number of devices participating in the network is crucial for a product such as AirTag. Apple describes its Find My service as a “vast, global network” and allows third-party accessory makers to release products that use it, too. If an AirTag is lost in the middle of a desert with no Apple devices in Bluetooth range, it can’t connect to the internet to send signals or update the user’s map. But in the middle of an American city, where an estimated 42% of people have iPhones — more in some areas — you’re much more likely to find a device that’s looking for your lost AirTag. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously described Apple’s product strategy as “only Apple,” suggesting that because the company builds hardware, develops software and runs its own online services, it can introduce features that rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Samsung can’t. While Samsung and other major smartphone vendors have similar numbers of phones in people’s hands, they don’t control the underlying operating system, making features such as Find My much more difficult to implement widely at once. For Apple, AirTag is probably an effort to add distinguishing features to its iPhone to discourage current users from switching to an Android device. It’s not likely to be a major revenue driver. “While the Airtags are incremental to our model we do not believe even a very successful launch of that product will have much impact on our forecasts given the low $29 price point,” Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall wrote in a note Tuesday. If Apple becomes more skilled at using its installed devices as privacy-sensitive infrastructure, it could represent a durable advantage",error,513
999,"�We’re seeing strong first-time buyers on the Mac … it continues to run just south of 50%,” Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. “And, in China, it’s even higher than that … it’s more around two-thirds. And that speaks to people preferring to work on the Mac.”  Apple’s iPhone also reported strong results this quarter, quelling fears that the current annual cycle could slow down. Last year, Apple released iPhones with a new exterior design and 5G support, which many investors believed could prompt a major upgrade cycle, which this quarter’s results indicate.   In greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, Apple’s revenue increased over 87% year-over-year to $17.73 billion, although the comparison is to a quarter last year in which China was largely shut down in the early days of the pandemic. Every other geographical category, including the Americas and Europe, were also up on an annual basis.   Apple’s high-margin services business, including iCloud, App Store, and subscriptions like Apple Music, also showed 26.7% growth.  One metric that Apple uses to show the growth in services is the number of subscriptions it has, which not only include its own subscriptions like Apple One, but also subscriptions through its App Store. “We now have over 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on the platform, and that’s up 40 million from the previous quarter, which is an acceleration from 35 million,” Cook told CNBC. However, Apple’s App Store has been challenged by lawmakers and companies that say it costs too much and has too much power. A closely-watched trial with Fortnite maker Epic Games over App Store policies kicks off next week. “The App Store has been an economic miracle. Last year, the estimates are that there was over a half a trillion dollars of economic activity because of the store. And, so, this has been just an economic gamechanger for not only the United States, but several countries around the world. And, we’re going to go in and tell our story. And we’ll see where it goes. But, we’re confident,” Cook told CNBC. Apple’s gross margin was also unusually elevated for the company. Most quarters, it tends to be",error,513
1005," have flown under the radar. According to a CNBC analysis of public reports, Apple has purchased 55 companies since January 2015, in line with a congressional report from last year and significantly lower than Cook’s own tally. People who have participated in Apple’s acquisition process say Apple expects discretion -- unsurprising given how secretive the company is. Apple generally doesn’t announce small acquisitions and warns staff at the acquired companies not to update LinkedIn profiles to say they were acquired by Apple. If a member of the media gets wind of a deal and asks, Apple sometimes confirms deals with a boilerplate phrase that it “generally does not discuss” its purpose or plans for acquired companies.  One person who sold a company to Apple said that after news of his deal broke, he could not respond to friends and family congratulating him. He asked not to be named because he is under non-disclosure agreements. While every deal is different in its specifics, there are a few commonalities to Apple’s approach. Apple is generally not interested in continuing the acquired company’s line of business, and forces acquired units to discontinue future products or shed customers. The revenue generated by smaller companies is usually immaterial and unimportant to Apple, which reported $274.52 billion in sales in its fiscal 2020. Apple is particularly interested in technical staff, who are often called “individual contributors” in Silicon Valley jargon. It’s less interested in hiring sales or support staff, according to people who have participated in the process. Apple has put conditions on transactions that a certain number of technical employees must join Apple or the deal would fall through. These technical employees get what are called “golden handcuffs,” or large stock packages that vest over three or four years. Acquired staff also get paid for their equity in the company that was acquired. Some people familiar with Apple’s process say that it assigns value to companies based on the number of technical employees, with a price tag of around $3 million per engineer, instead of basing it on the start-up’s revenue or fundraising track record. Often, Apple’s acquisition process starts after a demo to technical teams at Apple. Apple frequently invites other companies to show technology that Apple might want to partner with or license, and sometimes these meetings kick off an acquisition process. When a manager on those teams decides they want the technology or talent, they bring it up to the M&A team, which acts as a service",error,513
1005," organization helping Apple’s engineering groups close the transaction smoothly, a person familiar with the process said. Once the transaction is completed, Apple has a team that focuses on integrating the new employees into the specific technical group where they’ll contribute. Individual contributors who join Apple through an acquisition often stay past their first vesting cliff, meaning that their first large chunk of Apple stock has been granted to them, and can stay with the company for years, signaling an effective integration. For smaller deals, Apple doesn’t typically deploy bankers. Apple’s M&A team does due diligence, interviews team members and keeps the transaction on track to close. One person who declined to be named because of NDAs said that Apple’s team was unusually trustworthy and professional compared to other companies he had engaged in talks with, although they knew what they wanted to pay for the company when the process started, he said. A closer look at what Apple is buying can reveal where the company is expanding quickly. One field is in augmented and virtual reality technologies, where Apple has bought 12 companies since 2013 as it builds out the Technology Development Group (TDG) division, which is working on head-worn computers. Apple is working on a high-end VR headset for release in 2022 and more advanced, lightweight glasses in 2023 or later, according to reports. For example, in 2018 Apple bought Akonia Holographics, which worked on smart glasses lenses. Last year, Apple bought NextVR, which wrangled content for virtual reality headsets, and Spaces, a spin-off out of DreamWorks Animation that built location-based virtual reality experiences. More recently, Apple has been snapping up firms working on artificial intelligence, buying 25 companies in the space since 2016, according to GlobalData. Skilled workers in AI can be difficult to hire because many companies want them. Apple is also working to improve its Siri voice assistant to compete with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s assistant. Last year, Apple bought a Seattle-based firm called Xnor.ai for a reported $200 million. It followed that up by buying Ireland’s Voysis, which worked on understanding speech. In 2019, it bought Pullstring, which made tools to build talking toys like Barbie. Apple could certainly go for bigger game with more than $200 billion of cash and liquid investments and over $80 billion in annual free cash flow. Wall Street bankers have encouraged a big purchase in the past, and Apple did spend $1 billion to buy Intel",error,513
1049,"’t be as sophisticated as full apps or games. The king of mini-apps is WeChat, the massively popular Chinese-oriented messaging program made by Tencent.  Third-party developers have built more than a million mini-apps for WeChat to do everything from ordering delivery food, shopping online, or playing a quick game. They’re accessible through links directly in the WeChat interface, or through QR codes that can be found in magazines, at restaurants and stores, on business cards, and so on. 300 million of WeChat’s more than 1 billion users used mini apps daily in 2019, spending the equivalent of $115 billion, Tencent said earlier this year. Other Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, have also added mini programs into their apps.  The idea of mini-apps is beginning to catch on in the U.S. as well. Earlier this year, Snap announced what it calls “Minis,” which is the same concept, except inside Snapchat. Snap offers mini-apps made by third party developers for meditation, making flashcards, and polling friends. Mini-apps have not escaped Apple’s scrutiny entirely. In 2019, Tencent announced that it would stop accepting payment for digital goods inside mini-apps to conform with Apple’s rules. The company is also coming up with its own spin on the concept. Earlier this summer, it announced what it calls App Clips. Although it’s still in beta and hasn’t launched to the public yet, Apple says that App Clips are a way for developers to provide a “small part” of an app that doesn’t require the user to download the full program. App Clips are in a testing phase and won’t be available to the public until iOS 14, the latest version of the iPhone software comes out this fall. But Apple said in presentations this summer that App Clips are good for uses like ordering take-out from a restaurant or renting a scooter. There are several ways to install an App Clip: Users can scan a QR-code like image, or tap their phone against a configured sensor, or tap on a a link from the web.  Apple declined to comment on the record for this story. But its App Store guidelines and related developer agreements ban apps that “download, install, or execute code which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps.",error,513
1049,"” But WeChat and Snap fall under a different guideline, which says that code distribution cannot be the main purpose of an app, leaving a path for mini-apps. The code used to run mini-apps can’t be in a “store-like interface,” and must meet six requirements, including that the software is free, can be run in Safari, and meets all App Review guidelines. In addition, all developers of mini-apps must be registered as official developers with Apple. Apple allows developers to sideload apps to their iPhone from Xcode, software for making iPhone apps, so that they can test in-progress apps or show creations to friends and family.  AltStore automates this process, albeit in a way that most casual iPhone users will find a bit burdensome. It uses a Mac or Windows app, which is required to sideload the Altstore onto the iPhone. It also automatically refreshes Apple-imposed timers that cause sideloaded apps to become unusable after 7 days. Users are also limited to 3 apps using this method because of an Apple restriction.  This approach has other risks as well.Altstore requires the user to trust it, meaning it needs access to a user’s Apple account and password. If you’re installing files from around the internet, you don’t have Apple’s assurance that it’s free from malware. When Altstore first launched in September 2019, a lot of people told its creator, Riley Testut, that Apple would shut it down immediately. That didn’t happen, and Testut told CNBC he wants Altstore to become a “legitimate store.” AltStore arose out of a previous project: A Nintendo emulator so users could play Game Boy Advance games on their iPhones. After discussions with Apple’s app review team, in which he got conflicting information about whether his app would be allowed on the App Store, he came up with a new way to “sideload” his app onto an iPhone.    “Now that it’s been about a year and I’m on their radar, they have changed some stuff in the last year that affected me, like they changed how authentication works with the servers,” Testut said, but he “figured it out.” In August, Altstore announced that it had been downloaded 1 million times. Testut works on the project full-time with Caroline Moore,",error,513
1049," his business partner. For now, their income comes from supporters donating through Patreon for beta access and an invite to a Discord server. Moore said that one goal for Altstore was to prove that it’s possible to open up iOS to different ways to install software without compromising user security or experience. “We’re both big fans of Apple and love so many things Apple does,” Moore said. “The gatekeeping, we don’t fully agree with, and we’re trying to show that the platform can be opened up in a way that can still be safe for users. And that’s a huge part of Apple’s argument.” The most popular app on Altstore is Delta, the Nintendo emulator Testut originally wanted to publish on the App Store, but people have used it to sideload about 1,000 different apps. Developers from the open-source tradition often quietly distribute iPhone app installation files on sites like Github as a way to show off their programming chops or allow other developers to see and get ideas from the code. They also sometimes upload modified games, like a version of Pokemon Go that doesn’t require walking, Testut said. In August, Altstore tweeted a photo of Fortnite installed through its software. Testut said that it was a “tongue in cheek” response to the Apple-Epic legal battle, not a new app on Altstore, but he’s open to the idea. Tweet “I would love that if Epic wanted us to host Fortnite,” Testut said.  Airport, which launched in August, allows users to browse a list of curated beta apps on iPhones.  It uses TestFlight, which is an Apple service for testing software -- it allows software makers give access to pre-release apps to large groups of beta testers through a single link. Airport takes the TestFlight links from many different software makers and puts them into a single interface for browsing. Users can either download Airport from TestFlight, or access the list of apps through a web site. AirPort is only a list of links. It doesn’t host actual installation files. TestFlight app submissions are reviewed by Apple, so everything on the store has been reviewed by Apple. Airport’s focus is to give app makers feedback from lots of testers to improve their apps before release, co-creator Siddarth Sharma told CNBC. He and the other Airport co-creator, Jordan",error,513
1054," expanding into the TV market, and that a core part of that strategy would be a “skinny bundle” of pay-tv shows and movies from media companies alongside a streaming music service.  The “skinny bundle” never came to fruition, nor did the Apple-made physical TV that Icahn predicted. But in recent years, Apple has made some moves toward that vision. Last November, Apple released Apple TV+, a $4.99-per-month subscription that gives users access to Apple-funded TV shows, movies and documentaries. And inside the Apple TV app, users can subscribe to CBS All Access and Showtime, two streaming channels, for $9.99 per month, a savings of $11 per month over buying the two services separately.  But the idea of the Apple bundle and significant recurring revenue had took hold among people who felt at the time that Apple was undervalued. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski floated in 2016 that if Apple were to own its own content, it could bundle that with Apple Music and hardware like an Apple TV set-top box and iPhone for $50 per month. Bernstein analysts said around the same time that there was a case for Apple buying Netflix to create a bundle to combat Amazon Prime.  The concept of “Apple Prime” was born among Apple watchers and fans. It’s unclear what exactly Apple will bundle at what price. It sells a number of subscriptions that give it a good start: Apple hasn’t released subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, or Apple News+ since they launched last year. Apple Music has over 60 million subscribers. Apple said earlier this year it has 550 million subscribers, but that counts people who subscribe to an app on the App Store. The basic bundle could start with Apple Music and Apple TV+, according to a report from Bloomberg. Additional tiers would add Arcade, News+, and iCloud storage for an additional fee — but still less than what the services would cost separately.  One thing that’s unlikely to be included in the bundle: hardware. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked Cook directly about a hardware bundle on a conference call last fall. He didn’t shoot down the idea, but suggested that something like it was already in effect.  ″In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they’re on upgrade plans and so forth,” Cook",error,513
1056,"� Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement. “Apple has agreed to provide a brief, three-month respite after which struggling businesses will have to, yet again, pay Apple the full 30% App Store tax.” Facebook executives have become increasingly critical over Apple’s App Store rules, saying the company has an effective monopoly over how apps work across more than 1 billion devices in use around the world. In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” earlier this month, the head of Facebook-owned Instagram Adam Mosseri said Apple has “an immense amount of power” over its App Store and has control over how app-based businesses operate. Apple recently delayed a feature in its new iOS 14 software that would have made it easier for users to block companies from tracking their iPhone usage to gather data for targeted digital ads. Facebook warned that the feature would slow growth in its ad business and harm businesses that rely on Facebook ads. “They can just decide we can’t launch new apps at any given moment,” Mosseri said of Apple. “We’ve seen a series of articles and even some lawsuits and their influence and power over developers over the last couple months.”  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made similar comments to employees during an all-hands meeting this summer, according to leaked audio of the meeting obtained by BuzzFeed. Zuckerberg said in the August meeting that Apple has “this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones” and that the company charges “monopoly rents” to app makers, according to the report. Facebook also argued on Friday that Apple should allow users more control over default apps used on the iPhone for basic services like sending text messages. Apple’s latest iPhone software update, iOS 14, has a new feature that allows you to select default third-party apps for web browsing and e-mail, but not other basic functions. In an interview with The Information, Facebook’s VP in charge of its Messenger app said the company has repeatedly asked Apple over the years to give iPhone users the option to select Messenger as their default messaging app, something Google already allows on Android devices. The call echoes antitrust complaints Microsoft faced in the late 1990s and early 2000s over the way it packaged its own default apps for web browsing and other key functions PCs in the Windows operating system. But the irony in Facebook’s recent criticism over Apple should not be lost: Facebook is also",error,513
1058,", which makes distribution on Apple devices its own market because it does not need to fear that developers or consumers will abandon their iPhones. “Apple’s market power is durable due to high switching costs, ecosystem lock-in, and brand loyalty,” the report says. “It is unlikely there will be successful market entry to contest the dominance of iOS and Android.” Excluding rivals. The report found that Apple uses its control to exclude rivals and give its own apps and services a boost, including tweaking the search results for the App Store to promote its own apps, and using the App Store to boot competitors when it released competing products.  It points to when Apple released Screen Time, a feature for iPhones that parents could use to monitor their children’s usage of phones and tablets. Developers of parental control software complained after the feature was released that they were excluded from the lucrative market of iPhone owners, and the apps were reinstated after media attention.  “Here, Apple’s monopoly power over app distribution enabled it to exclude rivals to the benefit of Screen Time,” according to the report. Finding reasons to remove competitors. At one point, the report says that a former director of Apple’s review process said in an interview that Apple senior executives would find “pretextual reasons” to remove apps from the App Store, especially when they competed with Apple services. The report does not elaborate or give an example.  “Supra-normal profits.” The report also focuses on Apple’s 30% cut from in-app purchases made on an iPhone. It found that the company has become more insistent that developers use in-app purchases as the company’s services business, which includes the App Store, becomes a driver of growth and profits.  “Apple’s monopoly power over app distribution on iPhones permits the App Store to generate supra-normal profits. These profits are derived by extracting rents from developers, who either pass on price increases to consumers, or reduce investments in innovative new services,” the authors write.  Sherlocking. The report also examines how Apple often releases products or features that replicate what top app makers sell on the App Store, a topic that it correctly notes has a nickname among programmers for Apple products: Sherlocking. The Democratic staff cites former Apple CEO Steve Jobs saying that the company has “always been shameless about stealing great ideas” as evidence that Apple monitors its app store",error,513
1060," That segmentation increases the chance of having a suitable iPhone for every type of buyer, while likely raising the average selling price unless the Mini proves to be a runaway hit and sells more than the other versions. All of that creates a chance for an iPhone sales jump like Apple last saw in 2014. At the very least, it could spur a revenue jump like 2017. “It really comes down to if Apple can exceed the 231 million peak units from 2015. If they can, then this goes into the Cupertino hall of fame as a super cycle,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been predicting a super cycle for months, told CNBC in an interview Monday. “If they can’t, then the disappointment will be reflected in the stock. The only way is to execute on the super cycle.” But a super cycle is far from a slam dunk. Here’s why: Little compelling case for 5G. During Tuesday’s event, Apple started talking about 5G before it even mentioned the iPhone 12. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg made an appearance to brag about his company’s 5G expansion across the United States. There was a lot of talk from Apple about data speeds and jargon like “millimeter wave” thrown around. But the reality of 5G is that it’s not nearly as prolific as today’s 4G LTE networks. Even if you buy a 5G iPhone 12 this month, there’s a good chance you won’t be able to experience the top speeds Apple talked about. In addition, most of the apps you’re already using on your iPhone work just fine on 4G LTE. Those connections are more than fast enough for placing FaceTime calls, streaming YouTube videos or downloading a podcast in a few seconds. Apple failed to give a compelling, real-world use case for 5G on Tuesday, meaning at best a 5G iPhone will future-proof your device for when all those promises actually come to pass. Luckily for Apple, 5G is a messy, complicated idea to grasp, giving the company room to leverage its marketing muscle. People will be barraged with the message that the iPhone 12 is going to be faster, and carriers are giddy to help out with that message to push their 5G expansion through the iPhone. Only a small design change. Apple moved to new form factors in 2014 with the iPhone 6 and 2017 with the iPhone X. A new iPhone feels even newer when",error,513
1060," there’s a complete redesign. The iPhone 12 is technically a redesign, but it’s more of an iteration on the 2017 design than a brand new form factor. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. There’s a recession. The unemployment rate was 7.9% in the U.S. in September. Millions are out of work. Congress continues to stall on passing a new stimulus bill. Spending hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone just isn’t going to be an option for a lot of people around the world. On top of that, with so many brick-and-mortar stores closed or operating at limited capacity, Apple will have to rely more than ever on online orders. That means its shipping and logistics network needs to be up to snuff to grapple with the new demand. We’ll get a better sense of how that’s going as the new iPhones start to ship to the first customers next week. Years ago, Apple execs signaled that they knew they couldn’t report insane iPhone sales growth forever. Eventually, things would level out and the company would need a new source of growth. So Apple began talking up its services business, which includes things like App Store sales, streaming music subscriptions and purchases of extra storage in iCloud. That new mission came into clearer focus last month when Apple introduced its Apple One services bundle. And if it wants to go a step further and make Apple One even more compelling, it can still tie the iPhone into future bundles. On top of that, the company has released new hardware accessories like AirPods and Apple Watch, which have spurred impressive growth in its wearables business. Apple proved that it can cure its addiction to the iPhone and build a broad and profitable ecosystem around its massive base of about 1 billion iPhone users around the world. For example, Apple reported $142.38 billion in iPhone revenue for the fiscal year that ended in September 2019, down from $164.89 billion in the previous fiscal year. But its Wearables category grew from $17.38 billion to $24.48 billion and its Services category grew from $39.75 billion to $46.29 billion during the period. And don’t forget how investors have continued to reward Apple’s stock despite the iPhone sales slump. Shares are up nearly 65% year to date, and Apple hit its $2 trillion market cap milestone in August, just over two years after it hit $1 trillion. As long as iPhone",error,513
1063,", says the big move in Apple propelled more by multiple expansion than underlying earnings per share growth should be a concern for shareholders. “Has it achieved a metamorphosis into a services company? I’m not so sure about that. Yes, it is growing, but it is growing essentially no faster than most software companies and you can buy those directly if you want,” he said, adding that many trade at lower multiples when measuring price to sales. “You have a company that did aggressively go into a faster growth, higher margin business and investors have congratulated them for it, but I think it is precarious in the valuation,” he said. “It grows faster than hardware, but it is not explosive,10%-15% from the year before and that’s slower than some software companies.” Cowen’s Sankar says that investors can find software names growing faster on a sales basis, but Apple looks much better than many of these companies when taking into account its margin profile. “Its compound annual growth rate may be lower than a classic software as a service company, but at high gross margins,” he said. And there is also the market’s biggest cash cow of all, the iPhone, which will continue to generate more cash than any other product and serve as an “annuity” as services grows. A significant source of Apple services growth, though, faces a new risk into 2021: the billions in licensing fees Alphabet pays to have Google as the search engine default on iPhones. The Google licensing fees are attractive for Apple because there is no cost associated with the revenue. It is 100% gross margin to the company, whereas the gross margins on phones can range from 20% to 30%. “Lots of investors don’t realize a good chunk of the success of services propelling the multiple expansion has come from that Google relationship,” Meeks said. Cowen estimates the Google licensing fees in fiscal 2020 at 17% of Apple’s services business. But the services revenue overall has been growing, from $37 billion a few years ago to $56 billion this year. That makes the Google revenue, estimated at as much as $9 billion to $10 billion annually, a much smaller percentage than it was just a few years ago. “That is coming down and that is good news for Apple,” Sankar said. “But the flip side is that it is high margin, 100%",error,513
1063," margin, so if it goes away or gets cut in half, you’re looking at a gap in gross profit dollars of $9 billion to $10 billion and that hits the overall margin profile,” Sankar said. Every year the court case is extended and services grows, the importance of the Google deal goes down. “But don’t get me wrong, in terms of profit dollars it is very important,” Sankar said. The battle between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games which threatens the 30% fee Apple takes for App Store revenue to app developers is another risk, but Ives says what investors most feared, a ripple effect among all developers, hasn’t followed Epic’s bold move. “Epic played with firecrackers, but the Fort Sumter moment between developers and Apple never materialized.” At least, it has not yet. The court battle is not over and if Apple loses any legal challenges related to Fortnite in the future and has to take down the commission rate it charges, every investor will be focused on it, analysts say. But for now, Apple only conceded in the form of a reduction in its fee schedule for smaller developers, and did not extend that olive branch to successes the size of Epic Games. Other tech companies have also attacked the App Store model, including Spotify, Match Group, and Facebook. Congress probed Apple CEO Tim Cook in a hearing in July about the App Store’s fees and policies.  If commission rates are forced lower and it hits revenue for the App Store, which it will, that is a negative, but it is hard for analysts to forecast what the revenue reduction might be. Sankar thinks it will be manageable for Apple and among the two legal risks that are the most “imminent” threats to Apple, the Google case is the more significant. “The App Store and services ecosystem stays intact and grows,” Ives said. “Services has to continue to grow or else.” The core of the Apple story has not changed, and may not change for a long time. At its core, and as much as services has grown in investors’ estimation, the iPhone’s role in the Apple story is undiminished. “The most successful consumer product ever, that is the heart of story for decades to come,” Ives said. “Services, Airpods, Mac",error,513
1063,", and the most obvious target is Apple’s laggard status in streaming video content. “They have no furniture in the palace,” Ives said. “One-off projects won’t move the needle. Apple can spend billions on making a handful of movies and a dozen shows but when that is compared to Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Peacock and HBO Max, it won’t be enough.” He and other analysts see a studio deal as a move that could change the trajectory of what now seems like an impossible task of catching competitors in breadth of content. It is not a question of resources for Apple. “They have billions, they can easily pump out content, but I think they should consider a joint venture because competition is so fierce,” Meeks said. “They can produce anything they want with the biggest stars on the planet whenever they want, but it will take a long time to crank out,” he said. “It’s been on a treadmill approach and the window is closing to win in this area,” Ives said. “Unless the plan on buying a country, with all that cash after buybacks and dividends, it has to be a studio and content.” The company’s cash balance gives them the ability to do many things across verticals, and for investors right now, the lowest marks Apple receives are on the media side of the services business. As many users come off a one-year free trial, Apple lacks a huge content library and content production remaining limited by the pandemic is a source of weakness. “That’s the box investors haven’t checked for Apple yet,” Sankar said. “In services, they can do something bolder.” If the EV market is a trillion-dollar market over the next decade, Apple has to be a player in it, but the recent, renewed rumors about Apple making cars which have circulated for years make less sense to many analysts than a strategic relationship with a major EV market player. Apple glasses for virtual reality, and new iterations of AirPods and Macs, will continue to grind out incremental hardware success, as will its in-house chip production for multiple products which has been a recent focus and margin booster. There are some huge potential areas for Apple to jump across sectors, such as in health-care technology. But Apple has to be looking at the EV market",error,513
1067," in good faith to compensation consultants to study and understand whether it made sense. They could have chosen to do nothing.”  The past year was no ordinary year either. After a 2020 that included civil unrest in the U.S., the Black Lives matter movement, and a pandemic that showed the financial fragility and health risks across many communities and workers, there is more pressure on companies to focus on ESG themes, such as diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor policy. “For better or worse, this year the world is a lot different than it was last proxy season,” said Jannice Koors, senior managing director at Pearl Meyer, an executive compensation consultant. “Diversity, equity and inclusion is taking up a lot more bandwidth in boardrooms.”  Apple declined to comment to CNBC beyond citing the proxy language. “It will enter into the discussion more,” said Courtney Yu, head of research for executive compensation consulting firm Equilar. “What happened over the course of the past year and summer has helped supercharge lots of these processes and put direct focus on how companies are looking at diversity... and just their contribution to society in general.” An analysis by JUST Capital, which ranks corporations on ESG (Apple is No. 3 overall, behind tech peers Microsoft and Nvidia), found that in recent years among the Russell 1000 universe of companies about 20% have linked executive pay to ESG goals. That is consistent with other surveys showing between 10% and 20% of companies have some executive pay tied to ESG key performance indicators. Most are of the magnitude of the new Apple 10% swing factor in bonus pay, according to a Pearl Meyer survey from last summer. Roughly 25% of the firms that said they have an ESG pay component indicated it was less than 5%; 67% indicated it was 5% to 10%. Executive compensation and ESG experts say the data on companies that have incorporated ESG into pay can be misleading, though, and overstate the trend’s influence when the details are not considered. A significant percentage of the existing ESG compensation plans are in industries where they have been mandated for a long time due to safety concerns, such as in oil drilling, mining and other industrial operations where the risk of an accident is an immediate material and legal risk to the company. Or as Koors put it, “Old ESG versus emerging ESG. Emerging ESG is different.” If 15% of S&P",error,513
1067,", to incorporate, remains a challenging question. “That everything is important should be signalled, but on the flip side, if everything is important than nothing is important,” Koors said. Mercer’s Passin recommends no more than a handful of executive compensation metrics in total, and only one or two tied to ESG, though companies can have multiple factors considered within each category. “What are we measuring? That’s the bigger problem,” says Whittaker. Climate is an area in which metrics are maturing, such as reductions in carbon emissions across multiple well-defined scopes of emissions types. But not all ESG metrics are as easy to define. “The issue is there has been no generally accepted standard set of ESG metrics,” Whittaker said. In the Equilar 500, roughly 20% of the companies tie compensation to some kind of diversity metric, “and even there, it is very broad,” Yu said. There are quantitative measurements for gender pay gap or ethnic pay gap analysis, but there is no “monolithic approach,” says Koors. The issues should not deter companies from thinking about senior executive incentive plans, though, because they drive behavior and performance throughout an organization. “You need everyone in the boat all rowing in the same direction and the more companies that make a plan like this, it can cascade down through the entire management.”  “It’s typically the first step companies take, the bonus modifier,” Tomaino said. “Companies typically do not reorient a whole portion of equity incentive around ESG, but take an existing part of the cash bonus plan.” Even in taking its first step, Tomaino said Apple has done more than other companies that insert basic language into a proxy saying it is at the discretion of the company’s compensation committee to set targets for pay, and that could include ESG performance. Apple’s move is better than a blanket statement, but “it gives them a ton of wiggle room,” Whittaker said. “Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation.” More shareholder measures are coming soon, and targeting Apple peers among the market’s dominant tech firms. Tomaino said Zevin Asset Management will again introduce a measure at Alphabet for this year’s meeting. “Imp",error,513
1067,"act investors can now point to Apple and I think it is a powerful example,” Tomaino said. “Our argument is there is no better way to send a signal that it is mission critical than putting a portion of executive compensation at risk. I wouldn’t say Apple went from zero to 60. Apple went from zero to 30.” Microsoft, Intel and IBM already have a compensation plan in place that accomplishes something similar to Apple’s new incentive. An Alphabet spokeswoman told CNBC in an email that in “assessing the individual performance of our executive officers, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers their performance against a number of strategic goals, including those related to sustainability and diversity.”  Tomaino described Alphabet’s approach to similar resolutions introduced over the past three years as “less transparent” than Apple. “It is harder to tell if they are considering a change and their contention to us is that within each executive performance review there are certain basic sustainability issues on the table. Our contention is we want ESG aimed at senior officers and need more on what the mechanism is. And we have not been able to understand it over the past three years,” Tomaino said. For Apple, the proof that the ESG metric matters won’t come until next year. That is because companies do not actually detail their compensation awards and how they arrived at those awards until the following year’s proxy. “We have to wait and see how serious they are about using this tool now that they have it,” Tomaino said. Investors will be looking at the discussion in next year’s compensation section of the Apple proxy and how executive payouts moved up or down in respect to ESG. “That’s what we get with any other financial and we are already pushing on Apple to outline what investors would want to see.” “No one telegraphs this in advance,” Koors said. Apple has increased transparency on climate and raw materials relative to conservation, and investors want to see that metric-approach in supply chain risks and with diversity and inclusion. As examples, that can include recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities, and employee participation in affinity groups. “The labor issues in their supply chain are a big issue, as is progress on diversity in engineering,” Tomaino said. “Tim Cook has described these issues as mission critical and ESG is financially",error,513
1067," relevant right now and into the long term. It is time for Apple to put their money where their mouth is... a warts and all analysis. My message is consistent to companies: as an investor I don’t want to substitute my judgment for their own or micromanage. They tell me which are the most relevant factors for them and how to get there.” Companies should be less concerned about looking bad and more focused on how to improve, but that worry is in the air. “What does scare companies is having to report on it, if it is metric you have to disclose and talk about how you did next year,” Passin said. “It takes the brave company to be serious about this and put it in, in a real way.” But Passin does think we will start seeing purpose-driven compensation more tied to a multi-stakeholder view of a corporation.  Moving ESG into long-term incentive plans rather than just the annual cash bonus ultimately is appropriate, he said, and it is a conversation that Mercer is starting to have with clients. “But it is not going to be fast,” Passin said. “Holding executives accountable, just like with EPS and revenue, you need to be able to measure it. Metrics are not magic. You need a strategy on how to achieve it and how to build facts and end goals. Many companies are not ready yet.” Some critics of executive compensation are focused on the disparity between CEO pay and median worker income — Apple CEO Tim Cook makes 256 times the median Apple employee pay of roughly $58,000. And they say as long as CEOs are paid enormous sums, factoring ESG into that pay does not solve the larger problem. But Tomaino and other ESG experts said while wage disparity is among the bigger ESG issues, shareholders shouldn’t view it as overriding the broader ESG-linked compensation discussion. “It is the most profitable company in the world and the simple reality is high-pay decision makers should not be sheltered, isolated and unaccountable from what happens on the ground,” Tomaino said. “CEO to worker median pay ratio is one metric of how divorced a leader is from what’s happening on the ground, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. At Apple, imagine the gap between Tim Cook and not just the Apple software engineer but those who shuffle in and out of supply chain factories.",error,513
1072," an analyst at IDC, said two key factors were behind Apple’s success in China — attractive iPhone 12 models and the weakness of Chinese smartphone giant Huawei. The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro were the most-bought models due to good pricing and features such as screen size, according to Wong. Meanwhile, Huawei has been hurt by a number of U.S. sanctions that have effectively cut it off from key components like cutting-edge chips, which has opened the door for Apple to take some of its market share. In China, Huawei and Apple are seen as high-end smartphone players, according to Wong. Huawei has been slowing down supplies of its smartphones to distributors and retailers to make them last longer, Wong said. As a result, these distributors see reduced competition from Huawei. “The channel partners see the competition to Apple is lesser now and consumers are also likely to shift from Huawei to Apple in China,” Wong said. That has helped Apple increase shipments of its iPhone in China. Cook also said that Apple’s other products sold well in China. “We could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone,” the CEO said. “iPad did extremely well, far beyond the Company average. Mac was about the Company average. Wearables, Home and Accessories was above the Company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there.” Services revenue, which includes money made from the App Store and other products like cloud storage, has become an important part of the Apple story for investors. In the first few months of each year, Apple usually gets a boost from China because of increased spending by users around Lunar New Year. But in 2020, China went into lockdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak for much of February and March. Now, China generally has the virus under control and in many parts of the country, life is back to normal. On the earnings call, one analyst asked if the “seasonal bump” may not happen in 2021 due to the prolonged amount of time people spent at home in the previous year. Luca Maestri, chief financial officer at Apple, said that during the lockdown in China the “propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle.” He said that Apple expects “to have a great (March) quarter in China” but warned the comparison “is going to be particularly challenging because of what happened a",error,513
1085," broader cable bundle would have been a groundbreaking step. Even today, nearly six years later, consumers can’t buy a monthly subscription to a company’s linear networks separate from the larger cable bundle. The broader idea of selling direct-to-consumer has taken over the media ecosystem, with every major media company offering a streaming product of its own. The executives discussed the possibility of Apple being the exclusive provider of the offer, giving Apple device users the ability to purchase the Time Warner bundle through the iTunes store. Over a series of weeks, both Apple and Time Warner soured on the idea. Taking Turner’s networks outside the cable bundle would likely have led to a chorus of angry pay-TV distributors who thought they were paying for exclusive content. And Apple already offered media content — movies and TV shows — from a large number of media companies through the iTunes store. Time Warner wanted Apple to market the bundle globally, but Apple was hesitant to annoy its other media partners. During the talks, Bewkes and Cook broached the subject of Apple acquiring Time Warner to deal with one of the biggest hurdles of the $19-per-month concept: What if Apple or Time Warner eventually wanted to back out? Once the companies went live with the offer, they’d need to stay aligned. Walking away from the deal could be disastrous to both companies’ external relationships. Cue expressed interest in a full acquisition, but Cook ultimately wasn’t ready to pull the trigger on what likely would have been a nearly $100 billion deal, two of the people said. Neither Bewkes nor Cook had initially expected the talks to lead to thoughts of an acquisition, said the people. Time Warner had successfully fought off a hostile takeover offer from Fox a year earlier. A year later, in late 2016, Bewkes agreed to sell Time Warner to AT&T for more than $105 billion including debt. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Apple has another significant tie to WarnerMedia — former HBO chief Richard Plepler. Plepler left HBO after disagreeing with current AT&T CEO John Stankey about the direction of the premium network, as detailed by CNBC last year. Months later, he signed a five-year deal with Apple TV+ to produce TV series, documentaries and feature films exclusively for the streaming service. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the production of most of Plepler’s efforts, but some of his work at Eden Productions is beginning to trickle out, such as the limited series “",error,513
1087," Auto, aren’t car operating systems. It’s really phone software, said Mark Fitzgerald, analyst at Strategy Analytics. Ultimately, it’s like using your car’s display as an external monitor for your phone. “What’s in your car, when you plug it in, there is essentially a client software client that is just rendering stuff from your phone on your infotainment system display,” Fitzgerald said. Many users find that’s all they need. When users have both CarPlay and a built-in system, they tend to use CarPlay. 34% of CarPlay users surveyed in 2018 by Strategy Analytics said they only use CarPlay when in their car, and 33% said they mostly use CarPlay. Only 4% of surveyed users say they use the embedded system in favor of CarPlay. Apple has also expanded CarPlay over the years to make it more valuable to iPhone owners. When CarPlay first came out, it required a cord to connect your phone to your car. In 2015, Apple started supporting wireless Bluetooth connections, allowing users to start CarPlay just by getting in the car and having their phone connect. While it took a few years for new cars to support this feature, it’s now widespread. Last summer, Apple and BMW announced that users could use their iPhone to unlock car doors or even start the engine, and Apple is participating in a standards group to spread the feature to more car makers. Google has similar software, called Android Auto, that extends its Android operating system into the car’s dashboard. CarPlay and Android Auto are not mutually exclusive — a car that supports one typically supports the other. It’s popular, with its Android app having been downloaded 100 million times by 2020. When it started to become obvious to carmakers that the computing power and software in smartphones would improve much more rapidly than they’d be able to improve their built-in infotainment systems, they tried to adjust. The Car Connectivity Consortium, which includes most of the top car manufacturers and the most important suppliers, developed Mirrorlink, an open standard for connecting smartphones to car systems. It rolling out in 2011, but was quickly superseded by Apple and Google. Samsung, the standard’s biggest backer, and which which also owns a major dashboard supplier, stopped supporting Mirrorlink in its phones last year. No other major Android brand is still supporting it and the consortium’s website lists only several older devices as supported",error,513
1087," devices. Apple’s success with CarPlay explains the automotive industry’s interest in rumors that Apple plans to build its own car. If Apple had so much success taking over the dashboard, maybe the company can parlay that into a competitive vehicle. Since 2014, media reports have said Apple is exploring at least the software for a self-driving electric vehicle. Earlier this year, Hyundai said in an official statement that it was in talks with Apple about manufacturing its car before it walked back, most likely due to Apple’s strict secrecy requirements. Hyundai eventually said it was no longer in talks with Apple. Automotive execs showed outward confidence but respect for the challenge an automotive Apple might present. Volkswagen’s CEO said he was “not afraid” of Apple entering the market. BMW’s CEO said he “sleeps peacefully at night” in response to questions about Apple’s plans. Toyota’s CEO warned that making a smartphone is much different than making a car. Apple’s ultimate plans remain unclear. According to a Reuters report, Apple still could decide to sell software and hardware — an autonomous driving system — to carmakers, instead of designing its own vehicle. But if Apple were to enter the car world, it would require a fundamentally different strategy than CarPlay. CarPlay is mainly about making the iPhone more desirable. It also offers also other benefits to Apple, such as making Apple Music subscriptions more valuable -- people want to play music in their car, but need an easy way to control it while driving. In a March note, Citi analyst Jim Suva estimated that CarPlay could add $2 billion to Apple’s annual services sales. But CarPlay in itself is not a moneymaker. Currently, CarPlay is free in most new vehicles, from basic models all the way up to luxury SUVs. BMW used to charge users a monthly fee to access CarPlay, but stopped in 2019 after customers complained. Apple says doesn’t charge automakers to use the software. It’s not a licensing business. (If it were, Apple could bundle it at $750 per unit and sell 9 million units by 2025, generating $6.5 billion in sales, Suva estimates.) Apple could use its foothold in the car to support more of its ambitions. It’s already using its App Store distribution platform to encourage software developers to optimize their apps for the car, in categories such as finding a car charger, ordering food, or finding",error,513
1093,"t have noise canceling. Including the case, which recharges the buds, you get up to 15 hours with ANC on or 24 hours with it off. That’s on a par with AirPods’ promised 24 hours of battery life. The Beats Studio Buds don’t use Apple’s H1 chip, which means they don’t register with your iCloud account and automatically sync to all of your Apple devices. So, if you pair them with your iPhone, you then have to pair them again with an iPad or a Mac. You can’t just select them on those devices like you would with AirPods. That’s a big problem for me since I’m constantly switching between devices. And you can only pair them with one device at a time, which would have made this less of a problem. So, in my case, I have them paired with my Apple Watch for runs, but every time I want to listen on my iPhone I have to pair them again.  While you can still say “Hey Siri” to request a new song or something on a run, I found the button controls to skip or pause songs to be a little finicky. While I was running, for example, sometimes a double-tap didn’t register. There’s just not enough of a “click” to each press. And there aren’t volume controls on the buds like there are on the more expensive Powerbeats Pro.  And while the audio quality is fine, it lacks the boosted bass you’d find in something like Powerbeats Pro, which I really like while working out. It just amps me up a little more. These sound a bit duller compared to those headphones, even if they’re still balanced well. Lastly, the case doesn’t have wireless charging. It’s convenient to have if you wirelessly charge your phone, too, but it’s not a deal breaker for me. The standard USB-C charging works fine, and most Android phone owners, or folks who have newer Macs and iPads, already have that charger lying around. It depends. I like the size a lot, and I think they look cooler than AirPods. And I’d buy them myself if they had the H1 chip that let them pair easily with other Apple products.

The Biden administration on Friday ordered the FTC to write new regulations targeted at limiting manufacturers’ ability to hamper independent or do-it-yourself repairs as part of a sweeping executive order. New repair rules have not yet been drafted. “Tech and other companies impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools,” the White House wrote in a fact sheet about the order on Friday, linking to a story about fixing Apple products. Apple declined to comment on the White House executive order. The FTC has not said what it plans to do, but repair advocates want a few key policy changes, as detailed in its May report. They want companies to be required to make official replacement parts available. They want access to tools that could make repairs easier without reverse-engineering the tools or parts themselves. And ultimately, they want products to be designed with longer lifespans. Apple is not the only company that would be affected by these policies. Much of the recent pressure is on medical device companies and tractor manufacturers. But given Apple’s ubiquity, it has become a poster child for repair, especially because it promotes its environmental efforts as a corporate value. Apple has launched a program it calls the “Independent Repair Program” which gives repair shops the option to enter into a certification process and contract with Apple in order to get access to authentic Apple parts, tools and manuals. Apple has also reduced the price of its battery replacement for iPhones, and recent models have been designed to make it easier to replace a battery or cracked screen, according to iFixit. Plus, compared to other consumer electronics companies, Apple has a large existing network of stores and authorized repair shops. Still, many Apple products remain challenging to repair at home or as a business with no contact with Apple. iFixit, a company that provides disassembly instructions and sells replacement parts for gadgets, gives AirPods models a score of zero out of 10 for repairability. According to iFixit, repairing these earbuds involves soldering, hot air guns and slicing through glue — that is, if replacement battery parts are even available. In the end, a would-be home repairer would have to put the four-gram computer back together again",error,513
1103,". Apple provides “battery service” for AirPods, at the cost of $49 per earbud. But functionally, Apple simply gives you a replacement pair, and the old earbuds are recycled. It’s not a repair, it’s a replacement. And it’s expensive. AirPods originally cost $159, so opting for battery service costs more than half of the price of a new pair. Apple sold about 72.8 million AirPods units in 2020, according to a CounterPoint research estimate, so tens of millions of consumers will face the same lack of choice in the coming years. PodSwap is a Miami company founded by Emma Stritzinger and Emily Alpert which aims to keep AirPods “out of the landfill.” They’re not associated with Apple. They believe they’re the only company performing AirPod battery replacements, although other companies “refurbish” old AirPods, the founders told CNBC. The company was formed after the founders experienced dying AirPods themselves and thought that upgrading or replacing them would be wasteful and impractical. I recently replaced a pair of AirPods that were only holding a charge for 45 minutes -- too short to complete a phone call. I paid $59 on PodSwap’s Shopify site and a few days later received a replacement pair of AirPods with new batteries. They weren’t my old AirPods, they were another set that had their batteries replaced. Along with those new pods, PodSwap includes a box and a return label. It wants your old AirPods back. It then cleans and sanitizes the old pair, puts in new batteries and sends them out to the next person who wants to change the battery in their old AirPods. But PodSwap faces many challenges that show why repair advocates want new rules. Alpert said the design of the AirPod makes it challenging for repair shops or companies like theirs to do a lot of battery replacements. PodSwap’s process uses both robotics and manual labor, the founders said. “The process was developed through trial and error and a large number of units were ‘sacrificed’ and ultimately recycled. One major challenge we faced was overcoming the uniqueness of this product. Each AirPod is assembled with slight differences, which creates complexity in the disassembly,” Alpert said. PodSwap plans to soon offer service",error,513

Policy advisors and executives across industries are worried that the business sector is not planning for the long-term supply shocks that may be far worse than what has been a short-term crisis. The current commercial issues causing the supply chain shortages will end, but ” what frightens me the most is the geopolitical... the politics of this is just getting starting in Washington and Beijing,” Dewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global, who worked for the Secretary of Defense on East Asia and China security relations during the Obama administration, said at a recent CNBC Technology Executive Council Town Hall. Policy discussions about a semiconductor “rebalance” and “sovereignty of the supply chain” or “minimal viable manufacturing capacity” have McNeal concerned that industry is unprepared for what is coming. If not handled properly, the resulting situation could lead to mandates on companies to buy a certain percentage of domestic chips. On Friday in an op-ed for The New York Times, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri outlined his proposal for a “made in America” rethinking of the supply chain including domestic content requirements. “Telling me how to allocate is bad for a chip CEO. Telling me where I need to locate is bad. So I’m concerned we have a real train wreck coming even when we got beyond some of the short-term stuff,” McNeal said. “The man-made stuff, the political stuff, I don’t know if industry is quite prepared to really understand how bad it is going to get between Washington and Beijing.” The auto industry is a good example, where the chip shortage continues to wreak havoc for carmakers. The car industry is all about efficiency and gaining scale, and in a future scenario in which companies have to start divvying up semiconductor buying based on a government mandate, “you start chipping away at these economies of scale,” said Mark Fields, former Ford CEO and current interim CEO at Hertz, on the recent CNBC TEC Town Hall. “It’s not a good economic choice.” Fields said over the past half-decade, many of the economic decisions made by automakers on where to source supply did not take into account the recent geopolitics and trade decisions and that may yet come back to haunt the automakers. “I think some manufacturers will be pretty surprised to see the economic decision or rationale that was so",error,513
1112," compelling back then really didn’t turn out to be the case. So I think there is going to be a lot of soul-searching over what’s the best thing to do to balance both the economics and the geopolitics of this.” The cost of disruption in recent years from Covid and trade has been significant and that has to result in companies rethinking supply chains and accepting that increased costs may be worth it if they de-risk the business “from some of those unknowns that can hit your business very significantly as they have in the past few years,” Fields said. Matt Murphy, CEO of Marvell Technology, which designs chips but outsources the manufacturing, said the situation should be on everyone’s radar, and it has been on his at least since the events of 2018 related to the Trump administration and Chinese cell phone maker Huawei. Murphy, who was head of the semiconductor industry trade association during that period, said the Huawei situation was “the undeniable signal if there ever was a signal sent about what the U.S. was prepared to do.” He said the politicians are dealing with substantial issues of importance to the industry, from IP theft originating in China to China’s broader flouting of World Trade Organization rules, but the extent to which the U.S. government went after Huawei — from targeting handsets all the way to its ability to procure components for enterprise gear — was a surprise. And he added the situation has not changed in ways executives expected it would. The Biden administration has “doubled down” on the policies of the prior administration, he said. “If there is only one thing Congress and government officials can agree on... it’s China,” Murphy said. “If Huawei is the preamble for what’s to come, it’s additional risks.” Ouster buys and sells a significant amount of material in China and a worsening of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China is bad for almost everyone, Frichtl said. But for the business community, he said the argument needs to be made in terms of economic competitiveness rather than saber-rattling. “What people want is the existence of a U.S.-based supply where right now it doesn’t really exist,” Frichtl said. “The investment to form those fabs can be thought about in a national security context, but it is",error,513
1123," win in New York City was a big one, the biggest union drives in recent years, whether at VW or Boeing, were notable failures. “I’m of the school that says there is something happening, but no indication yet it is even going to amount to a sizable increase in the level of unionization,” said Harry Katz, a professor and expert on collective bargaining at Cornell’s School of Industrial & Labor Relations. “6,000 Amazon workers is important... cafes, my heart is with them, but 15 to 20 per store, even though it’s now 50 stores, doesn’t amount to a lot. I’m not so sure the tide has turned so substantially yet,” he said. The CNBC survey results show that there is nuance within the majority support for increased unionization. When asked if unions have too much, too little, or just the right amount of power, survey respondents were evenly divided among all three responses. This view matches what labor experts say is a push and pull among workers between wanting a stronger voice on the job but being wary of conceding that voice to traditional labor leaders. The majority of workers, they say, prefer cooperative engagement to an adversarial relationship. “There is still some ambiguity in the minds of workers about turning to unions as the institution that will provide the answers,” Kochan said. “They are wary of having another boss. They already have one and don’t want to be told by largely older union leaders ‘this is the way we do it.’” However, once workers start organizing, getting support from unions can be helpful, and for a new generation of workers — many young workers who are college educated but also underemployed —these connections are likely to stay with them throughout careers at multiple companies. What is taking place within the workforce will require a shift in managerial ideology from what has long been an ingrained knee-jerk reaction to resist any forms of representation. “They are leaders and good people and care about their workforce, and to them, ‘The union will just get in the way.’ We’ve got to address that issue and engage the business community in recognizing these pressures are not going to go away,” Kochan said. The worker calls for more representation are playing out at levels below formal union elections, and are not limited to core employee demands related to wages, hours and working conditions. They want a say on",error,513
1123," issues as diverse as use of AI systems, company mission, and structural changes within the workplace, for example, worker councils which engage with management directly on issues like dispute resolution, or even a worker representative on the board of directors.  For the C-suite, it is a big leap. “They prefer to operate with direct communication and that goes back to strong notions within American management about their right to manage, and private property rights, and the law has supported that,” Katz says.  Starbucks hasn’t substantially changed its tune, nor has Amazon, and Apple last week stayed within the legal bounds of warning workers about the negative repercussions of joining a union.  The legal environment remains favorable to companies, as does the fact that the longer it takes for a union drive to play out, the more likely it is for momentum to wane. “In the midst of campaigns where companies are able to talk to workers very aggressively, and sometimes more moderately, about the ‘cost’ of unionization and risks that follow, worker support often wanes,” Katz said. “In some campaigns, employers cross the line and are coercive, but even in cases where they are not coercive, we see a long history that worker support wanes as campaigns go on,” he said. The history of labor movements also shows that it operates with its own cyclicality, and in tighter labor markets in which workers face less risk about losing jobs, there is a greater union push. But that can only go so far. The latest private payrolls report showed the slowest growth for new jobs in the current economic recovery, but by the government data, companies remain in a war to hire, if off the peak during the recent period of employment gains. “What really matters is structural change,” Katz said. This type of change happened shortly before, and then through the World War II period, and into the early 1950s, and couldn’t be explained by the business cycle effect of a tighter labor market. “The reason unionization has declined over the past four decades is not that workers don’t want it, it’s that policy relentlessly reversed,” said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist for the Department of Labor and current president of the Economic Policy Institute, which advocates for low- and middle-income workers. Union membership stood at 14 million workers in 2021, representing roughly 10 percent of American workers, a decline from 20%",error,513
1128," the platform, it has to go through a process called App Review. An Apple employee checks the app against a lengthy list of “guidelines” and, often within minutes, makes a decision whether the update is approved or whether the app maker needs to make changes, as CNBC previously reported. There are three primary issues developers say they have with the App Store:  Opaque review process. Developers say decisions made during App Review can seem arbitrary, and apps are often removed entirely from Apple’s platform over what developers characterize as minor or unfair reasons. In addition, it can be hard to communicate with Apple representatives and get reinstated. Basecamp’s Hansson had previously testified at a congressional hearing that app developers live in fear of an arbitrary Apple rejection.  The cut. Apple takes 30% cut of paid apps and in-app purchases. The cut for paid subscriptions drop to 15% after a year. Developers say Apple’s take is excessive and makes their own businesses significantly less profitable. In its most recent annual filing, Apple said it believes that people buy Apple computers based on the availability of third-party software and noted that developers can stop making software for Apple products if it seems less expensive or more lucrative to develop for competing operating systems such as Google’s Android or Microsoft Windows.  Unfair competition. Software makers also worry that Apple could use data about what is trending on the App Store to create competing Apple apps or features. Once those Apple features are introduced, they often use access to core parts of Apple operating systems that developers don’t have access to, developers allege. Apple introduces features that compete with existing software regularly enough that there’s a nickname for it — “Sherlocking.” It’s a reference to a search tool called Sherlock, which Apple introduced for Macs in 1998, that competed with a third-party product called Watson. Ronge said Astropad’s product was “Sherlocked” last year when Apple introduced a competing product, Sidecar, as part of its MacOS operating system, despite years of friendly relations between Astropad and Apple’s developer relations department. Because Sidecar is built into the operating system and uses system functions that Astropad does not have access to, it is hard to compete with Apple, Ronge says.  This week, Astropad published a blog post called “Dear Apple” suggesting that Apple gives users the",error,513
1128," ability to set default apps, offer alternative payment methods that don’t take a 30% cut, and allow some apps to be “sideloaded,” or installed in a way that doesn’t involve the App Store approval process. Apple argues that its close control over the App Store enables the company to make sure software running on iPhones is safe from a security perspective. It also notes that lots of companies make money on the App Store — both directly from Apple-facilitated payments, as well as through general commerce that happens through apps.  “We follow the law in everything we do and we embrace competition at every stage because we believe it pushes us to deliver even better results,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement. “It’s disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don’t want to play by the same rules as everyone else. We don’t think that’s right — we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed,” the statement continued.  Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, which pays Apple a 30% cut of digital products inside the hit game Fortnite for iPhones, reacted: “Here Apple speaks of a level playing field. To me, this means: All iOS developers are free to process payments directly, all users are free to install software from any source.” Antitrust pressure over the App Store is building in the United States, too. The House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel is working to get Apple CEO Tim Cook to testify on competition topics alongside chief executives from Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet, according to Politico.  The EU probe is likely a bigger concern for Apple than the “saber-rattling” in the House of Representatives, unless new antitrust legislation is passed, said Chris Sagers, professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. One issue for any potential antitrust case against Apple in the United States is that the iPhone doesn’t appear to have dominant market share against Google’s Android — only about 46% of the smartphones sold in the U.S. in the first quarter were Apple’s, according to Counterpoint Research. Google’s Google Play app store also takes a 30% cut of digital purchases. “The landscape is the same as it has been for the past five or seven years in",error,513
1129," into Apple’s App Store practices. The investigation comes after music streaming rival Spotify and e-reader firm Kobo filed formal complaints. Tinder and Fortnite have also raised concerns. “Apple’s anticompetitive behavior has intentionally disadvantaged competitors, created an unlevel playing field, and deprived consumers of meaningful choice for far too long,” said Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify’s head of global affairs and chief legal officer. “We welcome the European Commission’s decision to formally investigate Apple, and hope they’ll act with urgency to ensure fair competition on the iOS platform for all participants in the digital economy.” Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the EU Commission, said in a statement: ″Apple sets the rules for the distribution of apps to users of iPhones and iPads.” “It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices. We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for example with its music streaming service Apple Music or with Apple Books. I have therefore decided to take a close look at Apple’s App Store rules and their compliance with EU competition rules.”  The start-up executive mentioned earlier in this report said this is “one of the clearest cut anti-competitive cases in modern history” adding that the only reason the App Store hasn’t already fallen is due to it being “slightly unclear who exactly is being hurt (end consumers vs. app developers), not whether they are being hurt.” Many developers see the App Store as a valuable platform to reach a large number of customers. “It’s not a tax,” said Dave Thomson, chief of staff, product and design at Skyscanner, on his personal Twitter account. “It’s the cost of their service for having access to one of the greatest marketing channels in history. Last time I checked paying for an optional and extremely valuable product wasn’t a tax.” Either way, Apple probably doesn’t wish to have this debate taking place as it heads into Monday’s WWDC, where the company is expected to announce software updates for iPhones, iPads and Macs. It may also reveal details about its plan to move away from Intel-based chips, which",error,513
1132," public beta will be released in July, Apple said.  Future Macs will use Apple-designed chips, Apple said. Apple has been using Intel chips in its Macs for the last 15 years. Cook said it is a “huge leap forward.” Apple said it is designing its own chips specifically for the Mac to provide more performance while using less power. Apple currently uses its own chips on its iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs, and said it had shipped over 2 billion chips so far. Macs with Apple’s own chips will be able to run iPhone and iPad software. The transition will require software makers to update their software for compatibility. Apple says that developers can get their new apps running in a “couple of days” and that there is a number of new software features that enable developers to easily port their apps. Apple said that Microsoft and Adobe are already updating their software, including Photoshop and Excel, to run on the new Macs.  “Everything developers need to build apps for these new chips is included in Xcode,” Apple software SVP Craig Federighi said.  Users will be able to use apps that haven’t been updated through a new feature called Rosetta 2, which will provide backwards compatibility with Intel-based features. It will also support “virtual machines” that enable software makers to run Linux as an app inside MacOS. Apple’s own professional apps, including Final Cut Pro, are already compatible with the new Apple chips, Apple said.  Apple did not announce new consumer computers using its new chips but will make a version of the Mac Mini with an Apple chip available to software developers.  Cook said that Apple will ship its first Macs with its own chips by the end of the year and that Apple plans for the transition to take about two years. Apple has introduced a new translation app, called Translate, that enables real-time translation between two different languages.  An iPhone with the Translate app can be put in between two people speaking different languages and can translate what they are saying in real time.  Apple announced new updates to CarPlay, its software that enables an iPhone to pair with a supported head unit so users can control their iPhone while driving.  The biggest update is digital car keys in iOS 14 and iOS 13, which enables users to unlock and start their car from their phone. The first supported car is the 2021 BMW 5-series, which will be released",error,513
1132," next month, Apple said. The keys can be shared through an iMessage, and users can deactivate keys remotely through iCloud. Apple said it was working on standards with industry groups to bring the feature to more cars and expects to see a new standard using Apple’s ultra-wideband chip next year.  Apple introduced a new lightweight form of software it calls App Clips that can be launched through the web or a text message. App Clips are less than 10 megabytes.  Users can tap an NFC tile or scan a QR code-like image to pull up an App Clip at participating businesses. Users can sign into an App Clip using Apple’s sign-in method and pay through Apple Pay.  Apple addressed privacy changes in the app store, too. Apple introduced a new “nutrition label” for apps that summarizes an app’s privacy policy. It will be displayed on App Store pages, Apple said. Apple said that 200 million accounts had been created using Apple’s Sign In With Apple feature introduced last fall that allows users to sign into web services using an Apple account. Many Apple-developed iPad apps, including Photos, Music and Notes, have gotten iPad user interface updates with side bars and tool bars, Apple said on Monday.  Apple’s Siri feature is now included in a little button on the bottom right corner in the newest version of iOS 14. Apple also redesigned its search feature to look more like the search function on a Mac desktop. The new universal search can be used to launch apps, search the web or find contacts, Apple said. Apple announced new improvements to its iPad stylus, called Pencil. The Pencil can now be used to input text all over the iPad user interface, a feature Apple calls Scribble. For example, users can write directly in the Safari URL bar, which is automatically converted into text. If users scratch something out using the Pencil, it will be deleted.  Apple said that its wireless earbuds, AirPods, will now automatically switch from your iPhone to your computer when needed. Currently, a user needs to open the Bluetooth settings to switch to AirPods if they move between Apple devices. AirPods Pro will also support virtual surround sound, like at a movie theater, by measuring whether your head or device is moving.  The latest version of the Apple Watch software can track user sleep patterns using a machine learning model that senses motion at night. It includes a feature to nudge users to go to",error,513
1132," bed and new alarm features to gently wake users up. Sleep data will be graphed and analyzed inside the Apple Health app.  Apple also added several new “complications” to its Apple Watch software that enable features to be displayed directly on a watch’s interface. Apple renamed its Workout watch app to Fitness, and added dancing as a new workout feature. The newest version of Apple Watch software will enable users to share their watch face. Developers can offer pre-configured faces for their apps. The new Apple Watch software will also include a hand-washing timer for the first time. It will be available in public beta in July. The Home app now supports face recognition for home cameras using the facial recognition data inside a user’s photo app.  Apple redesigned its Home app, which controls smart home accessories such as smart bulbs, smart locks and cameras. It includes a new adaptive lighting feature that automatically controls the color and warmth of lighting inside the home.  Apple’s set-top box, the Apple TV, is getting a software update that includes support for multiple users and additional controller support for games. The latest version of the Apple TV can also display picture-in-picture, if you need to, for example, monitor financial news while watching a workout video.  Aside from the technology transition, Big Sur includes new system sounds, a redesigned notification center and additional widget features. The new notification center can be accessed by clicking on the time in the upper right corner, which includes widgets and toggles for sound, brightness and wireless connectivity.  Apple also updated its Messages app to add features to mirror the new iPhone version, including pinned threads and messages search.  Last year, Apple introduced Catalyst, a new software that enables app makers to more easily port iPhone and iPad apps to the Mac. It got several improvements this year, Apple said, including the ability to write an app that takes over the full Mac desktop.  Apple will also offer a marketplace for Safari extensions as part of the Mac App Store. Safari’s start page and tabs have also been redesigned, and it can translate websites automatically. The newest version of Safari will also display a privacy report for websites including which trackers are running. “We love the Mac. It’s the tool we use to make all the products we put out into the world,” Apple designer Alan Dye said in a videotaped demo.  The public beta of macOS Big Sur launches in July.

Both have been critical of Apple, and have even testified in front of Congress about the company’s control over mobile apps. These aren’t small companies. Epic Games alone has a $17 billion private valuation and is backed by Chinese internet powerhouse Tencent, for example. They all have the lawyers, the money and the anger to keep this fight dragging on as long as they want. On top of that, they can afford to lose a little business through the App Store, unlike smaller app makers who feel constrained by Apple’s rules and don’t want to risk retaliation by speaking out. Equally as important as the money are the user bases. Epic’s Fortnite game has at least 350 million registered users playing billions of hours a month. Match Group has more than 10 million paying subscribers across its dating apps, on top of the tens of millions more who use the services for free. Microsoft and Google’s video game services have the potential to turn video games into huge, Netflix-like subscription businesses. And so on. Epic’s brilliant move was to leverage that huge fan base against Apple’s policies, painting it as the kind of evil corporate monolith it once stood up against. Hey, kids, do you want to play Fortnite on your iPhone? Well, you can’t. Blame Apple. I have a feeling this won’t be the last company to take a stand like this. Take the short-term hit and hope Apple grants some sort of concession. There’s one other piece to the puzzle. Google, which operates Google Play, the primary app store for Android devices, also removed Fortnite on Thursday. Google also takes a 30% cut of purchases through Google Play. But Google said users can still download Fortnite through other, third-party app stores, which are allowed on Android devices. Apple doesn’t allow third parties to operate app stores on the iPhone. But app makers aren’t targeting Google as aggressively and are instead focusing their attention on Apple. Even though Android dominates the smartphone operating system market, Apple brings in more sales through its App Store. In Epic’s case, the company has generated over $43 million in sales through Apple’s App Store in the last 30 days, according to data from research firm Sensor Tower provided to CNBC. It generated only a little more than $3 million",error,513

Developers can also deliver cloud gaming via the Safari browser, Apple said. Apple has continued to engage with Facebook to provide them with helpful feedback on how to get their apps to comply with the iOS App Store’s guidelines, Apple said. Rubin responded on Twitter to Apple’s claims after this story ran. “Apple claimed to offer us ‘helpful feedback’ in this story,” Rubin said. “Responding to multiple requests for approval of our iOS cloud concepts with ″this fails under policy’ is better than the radio silence we have experienced at times in the past, but that’s hardly ‘helpful feedback,’” he said. The official Facebook Gaming account also took a jab at Apple on Twitter: “You’ll just need the Facebook app on Android. iOS won’t work for now. Because, Apple (sigh.).”  The games are not console quality or even on a par with cloud-gaming subscription services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna or Microsoft’s xCloud. They’re versions of mobile games you can already download on a phone or tablet. They include titles like “Asphalt 9: Legends,” which is a 3D racer, and “PGA TOUR Golf Shootout,” a 3D golfing game. Users will be able to play the free games using their touchscreens or mouse and keyboards. “We think this will expand very quickly because we’re not charging up front and you don’t need to have a controller,” Rubin said.  Facebook’s launch of cloud gaming comes less than a year after it spent a reported $78 million to acquire PlayGiga, a Spanish cloud-gaming start-up. An estimated 380 million monthly users already play simple HTML5 games on Facebook, but these cloud games will bolster the quality of the social network’s gaming catalog.  Cloud games should provide Facebook a two-fold benefit. Better games could drive more users to spend more time on Facebook, increasing the company’s average revenue per user — a key metric in the company’s quarterly earnings results. Additionally, developers who add their games to Facebook will be able to advertise playable demos of those games",error,513
1153,"�Now in computing, they own everything from silicon to the software to how the user moves the mouse around, so it’s tremendously integrated.” Controlling its own technologies helps Apple integrate its products more deeply. It also means that it runs its own schedule — chips take 3 years to develop, Apple senior vice president Johny Srouji said last year — and has more control over costs. “Apple thinks they can innovate faster than the standard business model of Intel or Qualcomm doing the development on chips and then they build on top of it,” Lam said. Intel is falling behind in manufacturing. Apple proudly said on Tuesday that the M1 chip in the new Macs uses 5-nanometer transistors. “Five-nanometer is the leading edge of process technology right now and there are only a few products out at this point,” Gartner research director Jon Erensen said. Currently, Intel is shipping chips with 10-nanometer transistors. In general, the more transistors a chipmaker can fit into the same space, the more efficient the chip is. Currently, Intel ships chips only with 10-nanometer transistors. Intel famously controls its own factories, called “fabs,” around the world, compared to Apple, which contracts with companies in Asia to manufacture chips to its own specifications. But Apple’s chip manufacturing partner, TSMC, can make 5-nanometer chips while Intel can’t. “Intel’s had some challenges over the last couple of years on the manufacturing side. And I think those challenges have opened a window or opportunity for ARM-based designs for come in. Apple is one of the the best ARM-based processor designers out there,”  Erensen said. Earlier this year, Intel CEO Bob Swan said that it was considering outsourcing its manufacturing, like what Apple does. “With the challenges that Intel has had moving to 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer while foundries like TSMC and Samsung have pushed more aggressively, it’s taken one of Intel’s key advantages and leveled the playing field a bit,” Erensen said. More battery life, potentially better performance, and laptops that work like phones. Apple says that the M1 Macs are better products than the older models, mainly because Apple claims its chips enbable better performance and longer battery life than it could achieve using Intel’s chips.

I think this is really despicable and not acceptable,” Badiucao said. “Ultimately, the customers will decide the reaction of the company, as they are only doing this to meet our desire, so the power is still within the consumer,” he said. Nike in a statement to CNBC on Thursday denied lobbying against the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act or any other forced labor legislation, saying it has “long prioritized constructive discussions on issues of respecting human rights” with members of Congress. The company said it doesn’t source products from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, and its contract suppliers don’t procure textiles there. Coca-Cola said it prohibits forced labor in its supply chain and uses independent, third-party audits to enforce its guidelines. A facility in Xinjiang that supplies sugar to a local bottling operation “successfully completed an audit in 2019,” the company said Thursday. Coca-Cola added that it does not import goods from that facility, called COFCO Tunhe, or the region of Xinjiang into the United States. Apple told CNBC that it found no evidence of forced labor among its China-based suppliers during an investigation it carried out this year. The company said it conducts regular assessments including surprise audits. “Apple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect. We abhor forced labor and support the goals of Uygher Forced Labor Prevention Act,” Apple said in a statement. One of Badiucao’s satirical images tries to draw a visual contrast with Nike’s endorsement of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s “take a knee” initiative. The Apple image mimics the company’s iPhone advertising, but changes the product name to “iChain.” Badiucao suggested that corporations generally are able to “exploit this information black hole created by the Chinese government,” with consumers often unaware of events on the ground owing to the government’s control on information from the region. On Wednesday, the U.S. government issued a ban on cotton and cotton products from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), one of China’s largest producers. Badi",error,513
1162," of the reasons the AirPods are so successful. You just turn the AirPods Max on, bring your iPhone or iPad nearby, and tap a pop-up that says “connect.” That’s it. There’s no need to poke through your Bluetooth settings for the connection. I like that it’s easy to switch between an iPhone, Mac or iPad, too. But, they don’t have a 3.5 mm headphone jack so you’ll need to buy an adapter and a cord if you want to use them with non-Bluetooth devices. You don’t need an Apple gadget to use the AirPods Max. They’ll connect to Android phones, Windows PCs and other devices like any other Bluetooth headset. They sound really good to me. I’ll revisit more in my full review, but I also don’t know that I could stand here right now and pinpoint exactly how much better they sound than a pair of Bose or Sony headphones. The noise cancellation is pretty solid: I didn’t hear people talking in the room next to me while I was working. I’m not sure how they’ll compare on an airplane to Bose yet, though. And I won’t be flying anytime soon for obvious reasons. Apple has a few tricks competitors don’t have, like Spatial Audio, which makes it sound like noises in a movie are coming from all around you and from the source, like your iPad or iPhone. It’s a cool feature Apple recently added to the AirPods Pro. There are lots of sensors, so the headphones pause audio when you take them off, or even when you lift an earcup. That works well. Finally, I tested the microphones with a quick 10-minute call Wednesday. It seemed like the other side heard me just fine, and I could hear them perfectly. The AirPods Max are also pretty big. One of the reasons I love the AirPods Pro so much is that, back when we could travel, I was able to leave my Bose headphones at home and use the noise cancellation in the much smaller earbuds. They just slip in my pocket and I can carry them with me wherever I go. The AirPods Max don’t have that convenience. They’re still big enough that you’ll need a bag to carry them around. But they’re perfect at",error,513

After that, you’ll just confirm you’re registering it to your Apple ID — and it’s all set. Then you just attach the AirTag to the item you want to track -- you can stick it on a keychain, drop it in a backpack or bag or put it in your wallet or purse -- and you’re ready to roll. Once you’re set up, you can track the location of any of your AirTags whenever you have an internet connection. Just open the “Find My” app on your iPhone or iPad, tap “Items,” and select the one you want to track. If you lose an AirTagged item somewhere — maybe you left it in an airport or at the park — visit the item’s page in the Find My app and tap “Lost Mode.” There, you can add a custom message and phone number for anyone who finds it, and sign up to receive a notification when it’s found. You can’t turn on notifications unless you’re out of its range — that’s actually very helpful, since it tells you if the item is still nearby by blocking you from setting notifications. If someone with an iPhone comes in range of the AirTag, they’ll receive a notification an AirTagged item is nearby. But even if they don’t pick it up, you’ll still get an alert on your iPhone showing where the AirTag was at that moment. I tried this by bringing my wife’s iPhone near the AirTag, and I got a notification on my iPhone saying the AirTag was at my address. This even works if someone with an Android device finds it, as long as the device has an NFC chip — and most modern devices do. I tested it by tapping it to the back of an Android phone, and the Android phone launched a web browser that showed my phone number and said the item was lost. Some of you may have privacy concerns — what if somebody drops an AirTag in your bag to track you? Apple says it has thought about this. If an AirTag is separated from its owner and is traveling with someone else — say you’re walking with one in",error,513
1190," Q2 as well, extremely strong growth in those businesses fueled primarily by remote work. And I think the question we’re all asking is will this continue? I think we will continue to see these businesses grow in 2021. The new iMacs are jaw-droppingly beautiful. The new iPads are real laptop replacements. And remote work will keep these devices as well as iPhone in high demand. And actually, at Superhuman, we just completed a study that underlines all of this. It turns out that 51% of U.S. remote workers are now buying productivity tools out of their own pockets and a further 17% more still plan to do so.” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said Apple’s valuation is still “at the lower end” considering the “transformative tech” it creates: “Some incredible growth years are still ahead of this company. Everything from hardware as a service — we talk about this. We refer to it as a 360 bundle, to be able to rent a Mac, an iPhone, your services all together. We think that’s coming in the next couple of years. We’re going to hear likely about mixed reality, those goggles at the developers’ conference. That’s part of the metaverse. That’s a big opportunity. And then remains what they do around automotive. That’s a, depending on how you look at the addressable market, multitrillion-dollar addressable market. So, I would say this: let’s just take a quick step back. This was a good quarter. It was a great quarter. I don’t know what the adjective is. It’s probably as good of a quarter, as much upside, as I’ve seen in a decade from Apple. What I can say is that the naysayers will say it’s not sustainable, and I understand that, but that has been a well-traveled theme around this and Apple year in, year out, delivers, and I think they’ll continue. I’ll leave with this thought: I have a prediction that Apple’s going to be the top-performing FAANG for 2021. I am well behind Google right now — I think they’re up 30-40%. Apple’s just up fractionally. And I continue to stand behind that. I think that results [Wednesday], they",error,513
1192," included a new framework giving users more transparency and control over apps that want to track them for advertising.  When users on the new iOS open an app, they see a pop-up asking if the app can access their unique device ID for advertisers. That pop-up will ask if they want to be tracked, and will show why the app wants you to opt in. For instance, an app might say you’ll get ads that are more relevant to your interests if you allow tracking. The impact is likely to vary. In January, MKM Partners released a study based on a framework to determine IDFA risk to online companies, based on seven factors. Of the companies examined, Amazon would be among the lowest tier of exposure, they said.  Experts largely see the “walled gardens” of Facebook, Google and Amazon as suffering less from the changes happening in the industry. Though advertising will lose much of the data the players have relied on, the large ones still have data around what people are doing on their own properties. But even on the tier of the walled gardens, the impact will depend, and social networks may have less data that marketers want than an e-commerce player like Amazon. “Not all walled gardens are created equal,” Mindshare chief data strategy officer Shane McAndrew said. When it comes to Amazon’s bread-and-butter ad products – ads that let companies buy placement within Amazon sites and apps – advertisers are likely to see little impact, said Will Tjernlund, chief marketing officer of Goat Consulting, a firm that focuses on brands selling on Amazon.  “The traditional, older advertising products within Amazon will see no effect. It should be just as good as normal,” Tjernlund said. “Since they use Amazon’s own data, they attract people within Amazon’s own websites or own apps.”  And if users are logged in across different Amazon properties, that data shouldn’t be impacted. For instance, if someone was logged in to Amazon’s IMDb TV upcoming app, that data could be used for marketing purposes on the Amazon app, even if that user had opted-out of sharing their ad identifier on their phone.  “All that data is fair game for use in targeting ads to Amazon users on Amazon-owned properties,” analyst and owner of website Mobile Dev Memo Eric Seufert said. Where advertisers could start to run into some difficulty",error,513
1192," with Amazon in a post-IDFA world involves the company’s ad products that involve off-site tracking, which aren’t a huge proportion of its business.  For instance, Amazon may struggle somewhat with its demand-side platform, which advertisers can use to reach consumers both on Amazon properties and on third-party sites. Amazon doesn’t break out revenue for its various products publicly, but experts believe ads running off-site are a fairly small proportion of its ad business. EMarketer estimates 89% of Amazon’s net digital ad revenues in the U.S. are from e-commerce channel ads, meaning on-site ads likely constitute the vast majority. Following the changes by Apple and Google, which is planning to deprecate third-party tracking cookies, tracking off-site is not going to be as easy. “It’s going to be a challenge for them to be able to buy media off-site off of their properties, using their data. We know that’s going to be an issue on desktop, it’s going to be an issue on mobile,” Forrester senior analyst Collin Colburn said. “The headwind is certainly going to be off-site, which has been a category that they’ve been trying to grow.” Amazon sits at the forefront of another trend in marketing. With so many consumers at home and not purchasing in stores at the beginning of the pandemic, brands were looking for even more intel into who their customers are and how they were buying.  Walmart, Target, CVS, Kroger and a slew of other companies have ad offerings in the “retail media” space – the ability to target ads for products where consumers are actually buying them on those sites. Forrester Research estimates brands spent at least $5 billion on retail media in 2020. Though some of these offerings have existed for years, retailers like Walmart have been doubling down in the area. “It’s booming. I mean, it’s absolutely huge at this point,” Colburn said. “We were very conservative in saying that brands spent at least $5 billion on retail media in 2020. It’s much more than that.”  In a world where advertisers have a more difficult time tracking consumers across sites, retail media solutions are a way to get more insight at the point of purchase.   “The problem is",error,513
1192," when you click on a Google ad or a Facebook ad, you don’t know if it’s converting or not,” former Amazon employee and CEO of CommerceIQ Guru Hariharan said. CommerceIQ advises brands on their Amazon business. “You know it got clicked but you don’t know who clicked it. So we’re seeing a bunch of those dollars moving.” Following Apple’s changes, “the ability for me to target you as a profile or a consumer is reduced, which means it becomes even less measurable, whereas Amazon and Walmart are becoming more and more measurable,” Hariharan said. “If you’re General Mills, Walmart becomes a lot more interesting to you because grocery shopping is still happening more on Walmart than on Amazon.” Advertisers want to know they’re getting their money’s worth. So even if they’re running a big branding effort that doesn’t necessarily urge a consumer to buy a pair of shorts or download an app right away, they want to know the advertising did something. Brands may be looking for environments to advertise that gives them those answers once that ability becomes more difficult, once they can no longer rely on as much third-party data. Amazon, with its extensive first-party data relationships with so many consumers, is increasingly positioning itself as one solution. Amazon’s booming advertising business is primarily being driven right now by purchase-driven advertising. This includes “low-hanging fruit” like sponsored ads in search or elsewhere on the site, Mediaocean chief marketing officer Aaron Goldman said. But Amazon is increasingly making a play for more brand-driven advertising as well, which could accelerate growth significantly. Amazon has already signaled it’s deepening its brand advertising initiatives. During its inaugural NewFronts presentation on Monday, the company highlighted opportunities for marketers to tap into its video properties, including streaming platforms Prime Video, IMDb TV and Twitch, as well as big-ticket events like “Thursday Night Football.” To that end, Amazon said its ad-supported video content now reaches more than 120 million monthly viewers.  Marketers and industry analysts told CNBC they believe it won’t be long before Amazon ramps up audio advertising as well. The company said as much last month at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s annual leadership meeting, where it teased its upcoming moves in the podcast ads space. The company can leverage its recent purchase",error,513
1212," power and has broadly supported competition reform. On Wednesday, top White House officials met with a group of companies including Big Tech critics Sonos and Yelp to hear their concerns about barriers to competition. The tech industry has launched an all-out attack on the legislative effort, fearing the damage it might cause. On Tuesday, Amazon, Apple and Google all addressed concerns in the bill through letters to the committee or public blog posts. Apple and Google stressed worries that the bill would force them to take risky moves with users’ data, like share it with other services or allow users to download unvetted apps. Klobuchar’s office denied that the bill would have that effect. Both Google and Amazon also stressed the bill could create negative consequences for consumers and small businesses that rely on their services. Amazon, for example, wrote that it would “make it difficult for us to guarantee one or two-day shipping for those small businesses’ products — key benefits of Amazon Prime for sellers and customers alike.” Klobuchar has previously said the bill would not force Amazon to stop offering Prime benefits. A draft manager’s amendment to the bill viewed by CNBC ahead of the markup and also shared in part by an industry group on social media showed changes to the original text that would address some of the companies’ privacy concerns. For example, one change makes clear that the bill in no way compels companies to share information with those parties considered to be national security risks. Companies also would be allowed to use narrowly tailored privacy and security protections as an affirmative defense to avoid liability under the statute. A senior Democratic aide close to the legislative process who was not authorized to speak on the record told CNBC the bill’s authors thought the original version already included such safeguards for privacy and security, but said the amendment is meant to make that extra clear. Nevertheless, the industry said those proposed changes were not enough to ease their concerns. Adam Kovacevich, who leads the tech-backed left of center Chamber of Progress, wrote on Twitter that the changes still leave problematic aspects of the bill in tact while potentially adding new issues. For example, he pointed to a section of the draft amended bill that says it would not impose liability on companies just for charging a fee for subscription services that gives platform users some sort of benefit, but suggested that may create a loophole to incentivize platforms to use subscriptions rather than free services to escape liability. “These changes concede every concern that has been raised about the bill — and solve none of them",error,513
1248," also Google by introducing a new way to buy character outfits and weapons at a discount by paying Epic Games directly instead of using Apple’s in-app purchase service, which is required for digital goods. Apple takes 30% cut of those sales. Users who paid Epic Games directly would receive a 20% discount on in-game currency, versus users who paid through Apple’s App Store or Google Play, who would pay a higher amount. On Thursday, in the Fortnite app, clicking on a button to purchase in-game items brings up a browser window and directs the user to input his credit card information into the Epic Games system. Apple said in its statement that Epic Games enabled a feature in its app that was not reviewed by the company’s App Review approval process. “They did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services,” Apple said.  Shortly after Fortnite’s removal from the App Store, Epic Games said that it has filed “legal papers” in response to Apple’s decision. The legal filing appeared to have been prepared before Apple removed Fortnite on Thursday. “Rather than tolerate this healthy competition and compete on the merits of its offering, Apple responded by removing Fortnite from sale on the App Store, which means that new users cannot download the app, and users who have already downloaded prior versions of the app from the App Store cannot update it to the latest version,” Epic Games said in the filing. Epic Games said it’s not looking for monetary compensation, but to legally force Apple to change its policies. Epic Games is also publicizing its battle with Apple inside the Fortnite game, which is played for billions of hours each month. Screens inside the game are displaying a 30-second video called “Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite.” It’s a parody of a famous Apple ad from the 1980s that framed the computer maker as a fighter against conformity.  “Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly,” the clip reads. “In retaliation, Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming ’1984′.” Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world. It’s available on a range of different devices, including Android phones, Windows and",error,513
1249,". When someone wants to make a new game, they can painstakingly create their own code to model 3D graphics, or they can use software like Unreal Engine, which also makes it possible to run the same game on multiple platforms — like on both Sony Playstation and Windows, for example. Even Nintendo now uses Unreal Engine to make Switch games.  Unreal Engine is now on its fourth major version and works across nearly every major computing platform. Even if you’re not a Fortnite player, you’re using Epic technology if you play PlayersUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or Rocket League, or Microsoft’s Minecraft Dungeons, among many other titles. Epic says that its use extends well beyond gaming: Software makers in the medical world use it to build training apps, and Hollywood studios use it to create realistic backgrounds and environments, for instance. Game makers who use the technology pay Epic 5% of revenues once their game makes over $1 million, or can negotiate a deal directly. Epic is a privately held company, and does not reveal how much money it makes from Unreal Engine versus its own properties. But the company is now valued at $17.3 billion after raising money from investors including Sony, Baillie Gifford, Fidelity, and Lightspeed last month. Investors believe that the ubiquity and future potential of the Unreal Engine is a large part of the company’s lofty valuation.  Epic says it will be forced to stop updating the Unreal Engine for iOS and Mac computers if it loses its developer account. This means it would be much harder for companies to build iPhone and Mac games using Unreal Engine. “By spring 2021, it is likely that Apple will refuse to accept any new apps and updates to existing apps that use the Unreal Engine due to Epic’s inability to access those tools,” Epic Games said in its Monday filing. This could lead to an exodus of developers looking for a different cross-platform tool that supports Apple devices, Epic said. In fact, while the Unreal Engine is popular on consoles and PCs, many mobile games use a competing engine, Unity, which has not been affected.  “Unreal is used in some mobile games, but only a small minority. Unity is far more pervasive, so hard to quantify the impact on the ban,” Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush said.  In a late Monday statement, Apple said it wants to keep Epic and its apps in its store",error,513
1251,"� Ark Invest’s Nick Grous said. “When we think about Apple, long term, we may not be focused on what other analysts are focused on, being iPhone sales and device sales. We’re actually really focused on their services.” In January 2016, Apple released new financials related to its services business, and Cook said: “I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge, and I do think that it’s probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on.” In 2017, Cook set an ambitious growth target for the business: Apple wanted to double its 2016 services revenue by 2020, which would put the goal at roughly $46 billion by this year.  It hit that goal six months ahead of schedule. In the quarter ending in June, Apple reported $13.16 billion in services revenue, accounting for about 22% of the company’s total sales.  Before Apple was able to get investors to look at it like a software company, its low P-E ratio compared with Big Tech peers like Microsoft was an object of fascination for techies and investors. Investors saw its hardware business as “hits-driven” and worried that future iPhones and iPads might not sell as well as they had in the past. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen remarked in 2015 that Apple traded like a “steel mill going out of business.” According to Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, the triumph underscores Cook’s unique strengths compared with founding CEO Steve Jobs. “Steve Jobs famously would focus on, ‘our goal is to determine the few things that we should do and do them as well as possible.’ And then because of the maturation of the smartphone market, I think that forced Tim Cook’s hand. He’s basically said OK, what is Apple good at? Now let’s apply that to a lot of different things,” said Forte. “And I think services is probably one of the best examples, meaning that Apple’s not just going to be a hardware company.” Apple’s services business is still half the size of its iPhone business, and largely depends on it — many of Apple’s services, like its AppleCare warranties or App Store, are directly targeted at its existing base of 1.5 billion devices, not at the larger market of Android or Windows users",error,513
1254,". Big technology stocks, on the other hand, have been a bright spot in a pandemic-stricken market as investors piled into internet names whose businesses have proved insulated amid a stay-at-home world.  “Until we get a broad economic recovery, I don’t think we can expect the Dow to lead,” Essaye said. The Dow was first created in the 1890s to model a regular investor’s portfolio — a simple average of the prices of all constituents. But it could be an outdated method nowadays in a sea of passive investment vehicles given its lack of diversification and high concentration. Apple’s split could also have some impact on managers of index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, who mimic the benchmark’s performance and changes.  For example, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), which has more than $23 billion in assets under management, tracks the old-fashioned average. Managers of these passive funds will have to buy shares in the rest of the index’s companies to fit the big hole from their Apple sales post the split. “It’s a four-for-one on the biggest stock you have,” Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, told CNBC. “If you own the fund, you had 11% of your money with Apple. All of a sudden, you are only in the 3%; you’ve got a heck of a lot to sell.” The split doesn’t impact Apple’s top position in the market cap-weighted S&P 500, to be sure, which has far more investor money following it. A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares. While a stock’s price is affected, the total dollar value of the shares remains the same. This will be Apple’s fifth stock split since it went public in 1980. The tech giant’s most recent split came in 2014, which ultimately led to its addition to the Dow. Some analysts believe a stock split can prompt a boost in retail share ownership as the cheaper share price is more accessible for individual investors. However, given Apple’s giant institutional ownership and the popularity of fractional trading, any boost from the retail crowd could be minimal. “I don’t think a flood of retail investors is going to send the stock much higher after",error,513
1269," but analysts and a report from Bloomberg suggest that the first event will focus on new Apple Watch and iPad models. The tagline on media invites to the stream is “Time Flies,” a seeming reference to the watch.  “While historically Apple has announced the new iPhone lineup at this time of the year, expectations this time around are for a delay in iPhone launches and for the event to focus on iPads and Apple Watch,” JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note on Wednesday.  Holding its iPhone event separately and later would mark a shift for the company. Since 2012, Apple has announced its new iPhones in September. However, the devices haven’t always gone on sale immediately after the launch event. In 2017, a redesigned, more expensive version of the iPhone, the iPhone X, went on sale in early November amid reports that the new design was hard to build and in short supply. Apple has also held October launch events in some years to release products that it did not have time to cover in September.  But an iPhone-free event won’t be a total surprise. Electronics manufacturing has been disrupted by the pandemic, and Apple’s employees have been mostly working from home since March. Restrictions on international travel has made trips to China to work out problems on the factory line significantly harder. In July, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in a call with analysts that the company is expecting iPhones to be available in October, or perhaps later. “As you know, last year we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year we project supply to be available a few weeks later,” he said. The iPhone is also becoming less important to Apple. In the most recent quarter ending in June, only 44% of Apple’s revenue was from iPhones. A year earlier, the iPhone made up 48% of revenue, and in the June 2015 quarter it was a whopping 64%. Meanwhile, iPad sales grew 31% in the June quarter, significantly higher than expected because of the pandemic. An updated model with a better screen and more power could tap into a large base of people looking for computers to work and entertain themselves while stuck at home. The Apple Watch is a core part of Apple’s “wearables” business, which is one of the company’s fastest-growing units. Chatterjee expects the new watch to have additional hardware sensors, which will make the updated version more attractive",error,513
1273," Apple is careful to explain that this isn’t a medical device. You can use it if you’re curious about your blood oxygen when you’re hiking at high altitudes, but Apple isn’t making any promises about detecting low oxygen should you fall ill with coronavirus. Finally, the Series 6 is available in several new colors, including blue aluminum (the model I have), red, graphite steel and a polished gold steel. I love the new blue color. It’s an option along with red in the $399 price range. This is the new braided solo loop band. It’s stretchy so you can pop your hand in and out without having to undo any straps. You have to buy the Series 6 if you want steel with the harder sapphire screen, since that isn’t an option on the two other models. I recommend sapphire if you scratch up watches as easily as I do. Alright, on to the other models. As a quick point, all of the features in the watches I’m about to talk about are also in the Apple Watch Series 6. I don’t have this model yet, but I think the Apple Watch SE is probably going to be a hot seller along with the $199 Series 3 given the price. It has the same-size screen as the Series 6, though it isn’t always on, so you need to lift your wrist to see it. It has fall detection, which can tell if you’ve accidentally fallen and even automatically dial 911 or your local emergency number. It has last year’s processor, which I’ve always found to be plenty fast for running applications, a new always-on altimeter so you can track your altitude as you hike or bike or just walk up stairs. And it has a new improved speaker and microphone for when you talk to Siri or place phone calls through your wrist. Like the Series 6, it supports Family Setup, so a family member, such as a child, can use an Apple Watch without an iPhone. So big differences here: It can’t do the ECG, doesn’t have the blood-oxygen monitor, doesn’t have an always-on display and is only available in aluminum models. For $279, that’s still a pretty good deal. The Series 3 is similar to the Apple Watch Series 3 that launched in 2017 for $329. It’",error,513
1276,", and provides high and low heart-rate notifications (as the cheaper Series 3 and Series SE do). The biggest new feature is a blood oxygen sensor. It’s easy enough to use: just open the app, rest your arm on a table and it’ll read out your oxygen. But I don’t know what I’m supposed to learn from it. Sometimes it says I have a 96% blood oxygen saturation. Sometimes it says 99%. I don’t really know what that means, and Apple doesn’t explain beyond that anything above 90% is normal. Apple says you might want to use the sensor at high altitudes, like during a hike, to see how you’re adjusting. But you shouldn’t use it for medical purposes, like if you think you might have coronavirus and want to watch your oxygen levels. For that, you should get an FDA-certified device. Apple is running three different studies to see how oxygen saturation levels can help people understand their health more. But, for now, don’t use it for medical purposes. I like the new blue color, which is fun but not too shiny and not too bold like the red model. I appreciate that the colors are offered in the most-affordable aluminum tier, which starts at $399. If you can spend more, I recommend stepping up to a stainless steel model, since those models and higher (titanium) come with the harder sapphire screens that are way more resistant to scratches than the glass on the regular Series 6. Stainless steel models start at $699 but include cellular sensors, too, so you can place calls, receive texts or stream music without an iPhone nearby. Finally, the Apple Watch software is still the best of any smartwatch on the market. It’s fast, there are thousands of apps that you can bring up on your wrist, and it’s a lot of fun to try to close the rings that indicate whether you’re getting enough exercise and burning enough calories. All the models work with Apple Pay so you can tap your watch to buy stuff at the store — particularly convenient during the coronavirus pandemic, when you might not want to touch a payment screen. I’m also excited for Apple Fitness+, which launches later this year and will provide workout stats right from your Apple Watch, like your heart rate, on an iPad, Apple TV or iPhone, while showing a workout video.

1281," The phones are expected to be visually different from past years’ models, giving users another reason to upgrade. In the spring, Apple released a $399 4.7-inch iPhone with a fingerprint sensor, the second-generation iPhone SE, this spring, which is expected to remain the least expensive iPhone after Tuesday’s launch.  “These 4 new models will accompany the 2nd generation iPhone SE launched in spring 2020 to comprise Apple’s most complete lineup of new iPhones ever,” Huberty wrote.  Currently, Apple sells the $699 iPhone 11 with a 6.1-inch screen, a $999 iPhone 11 Pro with a 5.8-inch screen, and a $1099 iPhone 11 Pro Max with a 6.5-inch screen. Apple may continue selling these models -- typically, it knocks $100 off the price of last year’s models and keeps them on store shelves. Apple’s tagline for the event is “Hi Speed,” a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones. Investors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G. But some industry leaders are cautious. For instance, AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh told CNBC in September that he did not believe it would be a “massive event.” Some of the impact may be blunted because there are three different varieties of 5G. The biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band. But in the United States, millimeter wave is only available in certain markets and has limitations about how far it can be transmitted. While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions.  AT&T and T-Mobile both currently claim “nationwide 5G,” using what’s referred to as low-band networks, which have speeds that are closer to the current fourth-generation LTE networks. That may underwhelm consumers who have been looking for a massive improvement.  Then there’s mid-band 5G, which does promise to be significantly faster and cover wide regions, but is still under construction. T-Mobile said",error,513
1281," this summer that it hoped to build its mid band network “over the next few years.” “Not all 5G is created equal, which has led to marketing noise from carriers regarding 5G performance and deployment,” Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster wrote in a newsletter in September. “In the end, both consumers and businesses are left unsure as to the timing of the 5G transformation.” Consumers won’t know until Tuesday if Apple will support all three versions in all its phones, or if it will offer different models sold in different regions based on which countries have the most developed 5G networks.  Apple CFO Luca Maestri said this summer that it expected iPhones to go on sale a “few weeks later” than the traditional September launch schedule. It’s possible that some models will go on sale shortly after the event while others take a longer time to hit store shelves, most likely due to challenges designing and manufacturing ten of millions of devices during a global pandemic. Last year, ten days elapsed between the launch event and the first iPhones that went on sale. “It remains somewhat speculative when exactly iPhones will be available for sale after this event as Apple typically announces the first day of sale during the event,” Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong wrote in a note this past week. Timing matters for investors because Apple’s first fiscal quarter has already started, kicking off on September 27. In past years, some new iPhone models have been on sale for the entire period, but this year that won’t be possible.  The number of weeks in the quarter that the new iPhones are on sale could affect Apple’s performance in the critical holiday quarter, as people around the world buy iPhones and other products as holiday gifts. iPhone timing can also suggest which models might be in short supply, which investors watch closely to try and predict average selling prices for the quarter, which affects revenue. “We also note that it is possible that certain models could either be more unit volume constrained or the new iPhone launch could be staggered similar to years past, although this possibility appears to be fading, as we have heard less about the potential for further delays recently,” Ong wrote.  The invitation to Apple’s event suggests it will last two hours, which is a lot of time to discuss phones. In the past, the company has loved to tease “one more thing” at the end of its events before it",error,513
1289,"t both an electric vehicle and an autonomous vehicle,” CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said. “Transportation will go through massive disruption.” So, how fast will it go, and how big can the change be for some of these companies? At press time, Foxconn and Apple had not responded to a CNBC.com request for comment on these reports. In Foxconn’s case, the change will likely be gradual, Kuala Lumpur-based CFRA Research analyst Hazim Bahari said.  The core idea at Foxconn is to become to the car industry what the Android operating system has been for cell phones — a lower-cost platform of basic technologies that partners can add to to create new vehicles, Bahari said. Announced in October, Foxconn’s parent Hon Hai says as many as 200 automakers have expressed interest in partnering to use the company’s MIH platform, and that it hopes to provide components or services to 10% of the world’s EVs by 2027. MIH can include everything from autonomous-driving software to batteries to manufactured components, Foxconn’s parent Hon Hai said in an analyst presentation in October. The MIH platform includes unibody chassis platforms, suspensions and battery pack designs that can be tailored to different automakers, Foxconn says. The company hopes to introduce solid-state batteries by 2024, which advocates say will eventually be safer, faster-charging and longer-lasting than today’s technology, but so far have been dauntingly expensive. The company hopes that building a new market supporting automakers will help offset maturing unit sales of cell phones, but progress will be slow, Bahari said. He expects that the project will generate only about 1% of Foxconn revenue, currently about $175 billion from all sources, within three to five years.  “The names I’ve heard (that Foxconn is working with) are mostly lesser-known, especially in China,” Bahari said before the Geely deal was announced. “How fast it happens all depends on the extent of sharing done on the platform technology. They will not all be sharing every technology they have.”  The Hyundai headline about Apple remains uncertain — Apple CEO Tim Cook said this weekend when asked in a TV interview about an “Apple Car” that he does not comment on rumors — but analysts do expect several alliances, possibly including one with Volkswagen, and the Cupertino giant can develop an Apple-",error,513
1289,"branded EV during this decade, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says. “I’d expect it to be something like [Apple’s] wearables business,” Ives said, referring to the growing business that includes the AirPod headphones and the Apple Watch. “Over the next five to seven years, EVs could be 5% to 10% of total revenue.″ The usual skepticism about Apple entering the car business is that making autos produces much lower profit margins than Apple is used to — General Motors’ profit last year was about 4.4% of sales, compared with almost 24% for Apple. But financial concerns about Apple’s car bet may be mistaken or just outdated, analysts said. Zino points out that EV makers like Tesla command much higher stock prices, relative to their profits, than do even well-run phone and services companies like Apple, whose stock is trading at 32 times earnings estimates for this year versus more than 200 times for Tesla. Letting investors think of Apple as an EV maker can boost its price-to-earnings multiple by an amount the market will determine, Zino said. GM recently hit a record stock price as Wall Street and investors become more confident in its EV investment strategy. And Morgan Stanley’s Apple expert, Katy Huberty, argues that Apple’s familiar pattern of vertical integration, controlling the software and design of all of its products even as it typically farms out actual manufacturing, can likely pull its profit margins in the auto business above 10%. She says the company has already invested heavily in batteries and other components of an Apple-branded electric vehicle. “A noticeable percentage of Apple’s revenue comes from products and services that didn’t exist three to five years ago,” Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said on a webcast with other Morgan analysts. “Smartphones are a $500 billion annual [market]. Apple has one-third. The mobility market is $10 trillion, so Apple would need only 2% to be the size of their iPhone business.″ But focusing on a handful of big consumer-facing names underplays the changes about to sweep through automaking over the next decade, says Brett Smith, director of technology at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. CAR’s research shows that companies from fields as diverse as semiconductors to consulting, as well as existing auto giants like General Motors and Ford, are re-evaluating how they work together",error,513
1296," And so, it’s hard to be strongly disappointed from my perspective. Guy Adami, director of advisor advocacy at Private Advisor Group, looked for the possible pitfalls: “It’s a ridiculously strong quarter. I mean, if you want the flip side of it, if you’re looking for the naysayer, it’s the fact that, listen, they smoked revenue. The revenue beat is ridiculous. And services revenue was a significant beat. Problem is, if people want to look for a problem, is now the product mix. Service revenue’s probably 14.5% of this quarter. Again, I’m probably nitpicking here and maybe that’s what the naysayer can look towards, but again, there’s really nothing not to like here other than the fact that it’s now trading probably 32 times or so next year’s numbers. That is the deep end of the pool for Apple, but again, a lot of people Jerome Powell included, have said valuations in this interest rate environment really don’t make a difference. So, I’m interested to see how it does trade … on the back of this.” Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster, shared some highlights from the company’s post-earnings conference call: “There was no kind of game of shuffle with the iPhone to get that good number. It was a real number. That was one thing. That’s why the stock kind of dipped a couple percent. And I want to quickly just highlight some other important things … from the call, and overall, the call has been very good. One is that the Mac business was supply constrained in the quarter. That was the only business that was just simply in line, but that probably means that there’s upside to the Street numbers for the March quarter when it comes to Mac. And then I want to give... [Morgan Stanley analyst] Katy Huberty some props here. She did something that as an analyst I always wish I could do. She did it marvelously, which was trying to get [Apple CEO] Tim [Cook] to talk about future products, and she disguised her question about Apple Car — if Apple’s working on a car — as ‘How do you think about new addressable markets?’ And Tim commented that we think about the user experience as important and segments where we can do both hardware,",error,513
1299,"” Brinley said. “It’s a very complex industry and it doesn’t get un-complexed just because you’re Apple.” Bloomberg reported Friday that the talks between Hyundai-Kia had “paused.” But a car from Apple would likely have the same impact on the auto industry regardless of the company producing the vehicle. To assist in hitting margins even near what the tech giant is used to with its consumer electronics, its “first vehicle” is expected to be autonomous, also known as self-driving. That means it is not designed to be driven by a human, but a computer using a suite of sensors and radar to “see” its environment. Autonomous vehicles have been promised for years, but other than a fleet of retrofitted vehicles with such technologies being operated by Alphabet’s Waymo in Arizona, others such as General Motors, Uber and Lyft have missed goals or completely given up because of the difficulty. An Apple car – known as Project Titan – has been on and off for years. In 2017, Apple secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. The company used already-built vehicles, including Lexus crossovers, and added Apple technology. While driving may seem somewhat simple, humans – pedestrians, bikers, other drivers – and things in our environment such as animals can be unpredictable, making it extremely difficult to program a vehicle to safely react in all situations. “When you look at the driving task, the most basic driving tasks like straight down the road between two lines or going around the corner, it’s not that hard,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Navigant. “That’s not the part that gets people in trouble. It’s when you start to get into all the unusual scenarios, the edge cases.” Abuelsamid said Apple has the money and potential expertise to develop such a system, but it remains a significantly difficult task. He expects an Apple car wouldn’t initially be for consumers, but services such as delivery and ride-hailing in select markets — areas targeted by many current companies developing self-driving vehicles. “This is not going to be a mainstream product, but more of a premium product, which is typical of Apple because the one consistent thing about Apple, no matter what products they build, is they only get into stuff where they can make a significant profit margin,�",error,513
1301," the revolutionary platform shift touted circa-2016,” said Mike Boland, technology analyst and founder of ARtillery Intelligence, in a recent report. “It’s not a silver bullet for everything we do in life and work as once hyped. But it will be transformative in narrower ways, and within a targeted set of use cases and verticals.” Here’s what the biggest companies in tech are doing to try and make augmented reality the next big thing: Apple’s generation-defining success with the iPhone has made it the company to watch in augmented reality -- even though the company has never confirmed it is working on a headset, glasses or any other kind of head-worn computer. Boland says that if Apple were to release a pair of AR glasses, it could “determine the fate of the AR industry,” given the company’s track record of popularizing new technologies. A report from Bloomberg last month suggested Apple’s first AR product could be out as early as next year. Its first shot will reportedly a battery-powered headset that’s primarily designed for virtual reality, but with on-board cameras to enable augmented reality as well. The report says this device could cost thousands of dollars and be available only in low volumes -- more typical of a test platform for software developers than the mass-market products Apple usually releases. Eventually Apple could take lessons it learns from the virtual reality headset and apply it to a pair of lightweight AR glasses with transparent displays. But according to Bloomberg, that project still faces additional work on technical issues such as miniaturization and lens technology. Display technology is another limiting factors for augmented reality. The transparent displays currently on the market have a limited field of view in which they can display graphics, are often not bright enough for daylight use, and generally could be better suited for all-day wear. Apple’s working on solving this problem, too, according to a report in Nikkei Asia. The newspaper says that Apple is working with TSMC, its primary processor manufacturer, to develop a new kind of augmented reality display that’s printed directly on wafers, or the base layer for chips. If Apple does eventually reveal a big leap forward in AR display technology -- especially if the technology is developed and owned by Apple instead of a supplier -- Apple could find itself with multi-year head-start in augmented reality as it did when the iPhone vaulted it to the head of the smartphone industry.",error,513
1301," Of course, that’s assuming that there’s software worth using when the headset comes out. But Apple has already laid the groundwork for a rich software library. In 2017, Apple released software called ARKit, which includes tools for software makers to determine how far away an object or wall is, if the phone is moving, or identify limbs in a human body, among other functions. Companies like Ikea, Target, and Amazon have already used ARKit, mostly for placing virtual furniture in a room to see if it fits. Warby Parker uses it to enable virtual glasses try-ons through its app. Snap uses new iPhone 3D sensors to improve its face-shifting lenses, which advertisers can purchase. But so far, few ARKit apps have found a wider audience. Apple is also adding hardware to its iPhones that hint at a headset-based future. High-end iPhones released in 2020 include advanced Lidar sensors embedded in their camera. These sensors can measure how far away objects are, and are currently used to execute fun filters and photo effects. But when paired with an advanced headset, their use could be more profound. Apple is considering using lidar sensors on its headset, according to The Information. One way to look at Apple’s investment in the technology is to look at the companies it’s bought in the field. It’s bought a company that builds transparent optics, a headset maker, and companies that make software and content for augmented and virtual reality, including Akonia Holographics, Vrvana, Metaio, Emotient, Flyby Media, Spaces, and NextVR. Google was the first major technology company to release a head-worn computer when it introduced Google Glass in 2013. It cost $1,500 at the time, and was explicitly targeted at people in the computer industry and early adopters, which Google called “explorers.” Google’s approach was significantly lighter and simpler than what’s come since. Google Glass did not attempt to use advanced processing to integrate computer graphics into the real world. Instead, it was equipped with a camera, and had a little transparent display with relatively low resolution on the right temple. That display was used to project small bits of information into the user’s field of vision -- sort of like an Apple Watch or smartwatch on the user’s face. But Google Glass was also a lightning rod for criticism -- it had a built-in video camera, and people who weren",error,513
1301,"’t wearing it felt like they were being watched. One wearer said she was assaulted outside a San Francisco bar in 2014 for wearing the glasses. Google paused Glass in 2015 and rejiggered it for business users. Last year, it started selling Google Glass for $999 per unit through some of its hardware resellers. One key application for Glass is Augmedix, which uses the headset’s camera to cut down on the time doctors spend on busywork. The Glass camera streams an interaction with patients to “scribes” hired by the company who write down the important details and enter them into the patient record. Last year, Google acquired North, a Canadian company making a pair of lightweight $1,000 smartglasses. Microsoft announced its augmented reality headset, Hololens, in 2015, and released the first version in 2016. It’s now on its second version, which costs $3,500. It’s a niche device targeted for business sales. (Microsoft’s tagline: “Work smarter with mixed reality.”) On its website, Microsoft touts manufacturing, retail, and healthcare as primary use cases. In factories, the headset can inform workers about how to fix or operate a complicated machine. Retailers, instead of having costly display items or large amounts of inventory, can virtually display their goods to customers, Microsoft suggests. Microsoft’s store currently has 343 HoloLens apps. None are household names, and many are simple demos that display graphics like a birthday cake or fireworks. Microsoft has invested heavily in these kind of technologies, purchasing AltspaceVR, a social network for virtual reality, in 2018. Before it launched Hololens, it paid $150 million for intellectual property from a smartglasses pioneer. It doesn’t break out Hololens sales or revenue. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks the most in public about his hopes for augmented reality. Last year, he said, “While I expect phones to still be our primary devices through most of this decade, at some point in the 2020s, we will get breakthrough augmented reality glasses that will redefine our relationship with technology.” Facebook’s enthusiasm for augmented reality is driven in part by its dependence on smartphone platforms from other vendors today. In particular, Facebook has been balking at Apple’s control over the iPhone for years, and the fight has escalated recently as Apple is planning technical changes to the iPhone software that will hurt Facebook’s main",error,513
1301," moneymaker, mobile advertising. If Facebook creates the next big platform, then it will set the rules. Zuckerberg is also predicting massive societal change stemming from augmented reality: “Imagine if you could live anywhere you chose and access any job anywhere else.” Facebook is already a leader in virtual reality, augmented reality’s cousin. It bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, a move that signaled the start of massive investment in these technologies. The latest Oculus headset includes cameras, costs $300, and sold 1 million units in December, according to an estimate from SuperData. With cameras mounted on the front and powerful processing, virtual reality headsets can approximate augmented reality by displaying a real-time feed of the outside world. This feature is called “passthrough” on recent Oculus headsets, and it could be Apple’s initial approach as well. The company is also working on lightweight AR glasses and hopes to launch a product this year in partnership with Luxottica, the sunglasses giant, CNBC previously reported. Facebook is also working on “Project Aria,” which is a research-oriented pair of computer glasses that don’t have advanced AR displays, but can record video, audio, track the user’s eyes, and access location data. Amazon is the tech giant with the least public enthusiasm about augmented reality technology, but it does sell a pair of smart glasses called Echo Frames. These don’t even have a display. Instead, the user interacts entirely through Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant. Amazon is also attacking augmented reality different angles. Last fall it released an “Amazon Augmented Reality” app, but it’s not a serious piece of software. Instead, it uses QR codes on Amazon shipping boxes to activate fun mini-games, like turning an Amazon box into a race car, or putting fun sunglasses on a dog. “Augmented reality is a fun way to reuse your Amazon boxes until you’re ready to drop them in the recycling bin,” according to the app’s description. Other Amazon applications use augmented reality to place virtual furniture inside the user’s home to make sure it fits before making an online purchase. But Amazon has many of the pieces to take augmented reality more seriously. It has expertise in computer vision, or the software that can identify what objects in a photo or video are. It has an industry-leading voice assistant that could be deeply integrated with the headset. Amazon also has hundreds of",error,513
1315," Charlotte that allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. Passed in 2016, the law also struck down all other local anti-discrimination ordinances and barred municipalities from enacting laws stricter than the state’s statutes. The law drew widespread criticism, including from business groups. The NBA pulled its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte, and the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference pulled tournaments from the state as well. In 2017, the legislature rewrote the law, removing the bathroom provisions but keeping the ban on local ordinances. That provision expired in December. Sources close to the negotiations with Apple confirm that diversity, equity and inclusion were a part of the talks on the North Carolina expansion, though it does not appear that the company laid out specific conditions before finalizing the deal. “There’s no question that Apple believes strongly in equity and inclusion, and doesn’t want to see those types of bills,” said Gov. Roy Cooper in a news conference announcing the project on April 26. Apple declined to comment on the North Carolina expansion, beyond its April statement.  Cooper, a Democrat, noted that Apple previously passed on a project on the same site in 2018, deciding instead to put it in Austin, Texas. “People surmise that maybe it was because of diversity and inclusion issues and HB2 hangover. I don’t know for sure,” he said. The executive director of the Research Triangle Partnership, an economic development organization that was not involved in the Apple deal but did help land a Google engineering hub in Durham with 1,000 jobs announced in March, believes the fallout from HB2 was a wakeup call in the state. “I think we learned our lesson as a state with that legislation,” said Ryan Combs.  “I think we know what’s important. It’s being a business-friendly state where everybody feels like they can get ahead. I think we’ve taken notice of that, and we’ve gone forward.” But North Carolina remains one of only five states with no public accommodation law protecting non-disabled residents from discrimination, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Also an important part of the post-pandemic landscape are incentives. While some states are de-emphasizing subsidies in their economic development efforts, states are nonetheless still touting incentives and cost reduction efforts in a big way. For North Carolina, fighting that battle required establishing a more robust incentive regime than it had",error,513

We are eager to carry these lessons forward, and with that in mind, I want to share our current plans for returning to the office in the months ahead. Know that, as we’ve done all along, we are monitoring local conditions closely and are prepared to make necessary adjustments to our planning.As of today, we are targeting February 1, 2022 to begin our hybrid work pilot in many global locations where teams have not yet returned to our corporate offices. We plan to start the pilot with a phased approach, welcoming people back to the office for one or two days a week for an initial period of four weeks. After this transitional period, we will begin the pilot in full, with eligible teams in the office three days a week, on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and with flexibility to work remotely on Wednesday and Friday. You’ll receive more details about how the first four-week phase will roll out as we get closer to the return date.As I noted when we announced our hybrid work pilot, we do have a number of teams whose work requires a greater need to work in-person, and they will come into the office four or five days a week based on the plans for these specific teams. Those plans will depend on your role and may differ according to your location. If you have any questions about your schedule, please talk to your manager.I am so looking forward to more of our teams being back together again. Our Retail store teams have been welcoming customers and offering the personal care and service they have come to expect from us. Some of our teams internationally have also returned to their offices and are benefiting from the ability to see one another and collaborate face to face. And nearly half of our Silicon Valley employees have been coming into the office at some point each week. Based on those experiences, we are confident in our protocols and our ability to ensure a thriving environment for everyone.At the same time, we are committed to giving you more flexibility as we move forward. In addition to the option of working remotely twice a week on Wednesday and Friday, we announced this summer that team members would be able to work remotely for up to two weeks per year with a manager’s approval. I’m pleased to share that we’re increasing the amount of time you can work remotely to a total of four weeks per year.

1324,"re getting our stuff ready to have the smallest manufacturable display for these customers,” Tang said.  I put the glasses on. A translucent blue square came on at the center of my field of view, showing a display that was overlaid on top of what I was seeing in real life. Then the demo started.  The glasses began to cycle through different visuals. The small translucent screen showed me the weather, a stock chart and a text message conversation. I was looking in the direction of Tang and could see him, but the visuals also appeared on top of him in crystal clarity. It was true augmented reality.  The highlight of the demo was when the glasses began to play a video. It was a snippet of a soccer match from this summer’s Euro 2020 tournament. I saw the green grass, the vast crowd and the players passing the ball to one another before the forward blasted a goal into the back of the net. The game looked as good and as big as it would if I was watching at home on my living room TV or sitting with friends at a sports bar. The Avegant light engine offers a 30-degree field of view and appeared like a rectangle in the middle of my line of sight. I handed the pair of glasses back to Tang, who put them on and began watching the demo. I could hardly tell he was watching anything, though I noticed a subtle hint of blue light on the lens. It appeared as if he was daydreaming. But there are still drawbacks. Manufacturers who use the Avegant light engine will have to determine how much battery life they want their smart glasses to have. The more battery life, the bulkier the glasses will be. Likewise, a 30-degree field of view is on a par with the first Hololens, but it’s a smaller window than Microsoft’s Hololens 2. Components like Avegant’s may help some tech companies develop smart glasses people will want to wear. But it’s still early days and skeptics don’t think we’ll have normal-looking smart glasses anytime soon. “The long-term vision here is to get rid of your phone in your hand, and you’ll wear your phone on your face,” Kevin Irwin, chief investment officer at Knollwood Investment, said. Irwin is an investor in Avegant.  Avegant isn’t yet mass-producing its light engine. It envisions a",error,513
1339," was one which OpenAI’s top executives, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, zeroed in on early when they were looking for a partner to pilot ChatGPT with that offered socially positive use cases. The adoption rates in education are higher than currently occurring in the world of work, and it is students, who have a high incentive to get help, who are “dragging teachers along for the ride,” Mollick said. In fact, teachers were the only demographic polled where year-over-year favorability declined, though a majority (59%) still have a positive view of AI chatbots. Older teachers and parents (those over 45) were less likely to have confidence in their ability to use AI effectively, but Khan said one of the reasons why Microsoft and his nonprofit wanted to get AI access to every educator in the U.S. is because of the time its use is saving teachers. Khan recently told CNBC that often, in the past, teachers have been told “If only you learned this one extra thing...” and that becomes a burden for an already overworked educator. “Teachers are already spread thin. Especially with these teacher tools, it is one more thing to learn,” he said. But Khan’s research with school districts to date has saved teachers 5-10 hours per week. “This is the first time in the journey of tech that we can tell teachers, ‘This will be fewer things for you to do. Yes, there’s a little bit of a learning curve, but it will save you time.’” Only 25% of teachers polled said they have received any training on AI chatbots, and roughly one-third (32%) say that lack of training and professional development are major reasons why they have not used AI. Teachers said they have used AI to generate ideas for classes (37%); for lesson plans and preparation of teaching materials (32%); for student worksheets or examples (32%); and to create quizzes or tests (31%). Mollick described himself as bullish on AI in education over the long term, but in the short term, he said these results are relatively high compared to past polling related to the introduction of new technology. “I was sort of surprised to see the numbers look as good as they do. I was surprised by how positive the feelings were among every group,” he said. “It’s not universally loved, but we",error,513
1339,"’re not seeing the strong negatives we usually see,” he said. It is early. Khan noted in his recent CNBC interview that the prime directive should be to never put technology in front of the use case. He said there are cases over past the 15 years where school districts have been able to “pretty dramatically accelerate outcomes because of technology, but many other cases where they bought the iPads and laptops and they are collecting dust.” The new data also indicates significant equity in AI usage in education. Minority groups are adopting AI for education at higher rates, including the teachers and parents who are using AI to help children. Black and Hispanic K-12 students and undergraduates were more likely to use AI for school. Among parents, 47% of those polled want AI chatbots to be used more in schools, compared to 36% who want it to be used less. Parental support for AI use in education is higher among Black (57%) and Hispanic parents (55%). Mollick said it is too early to attempt to piece together the economic and equity data conclusively — private school students were the most likely to use AI both personally and at school — but he added it’s worth taking a deeper dive into the data to ask whether AI could be filling existing gaps in the school system. “Now people have access to an AI tutor and now they don’t have to pay for a tutor,” he said. Khan said AI for the classroom is a scaling of the personalization that matches the founding story of his organization — when he personally provided tutoring to his cousin Nadia. AI could “get us that much closer to this ideal, in conjunction with everything else we’ve been doing over the years, of being able to emulate what a great tutor would do,” he recently told CNBC. “In my mind, it passes the Turing Test,” Khan said, referencing famed British mathematician and AI pioneer Alan Turing’s goal of computer intelligence being equal to human intelligence and humans being unable to identify one versus the other. “This is indistinguishable from when I went to text Nadia back in 2004.” The results pose plenty of questions for educators and parents. The value of in-class lectures is uncertain when a student can get all of the information from an AI, Mollick said, but the accuracy of an AI compared to a teacher, while generally good, remains an open question. “We need to be cautious about leaping all",error,513
1354," spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan. “Legal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,” another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision. That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption. “They decided they weren’t going to poke the bear anymore,” the person said, referring to Apple’s court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations. Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI’s arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed. “It’s because Apple was convinced,” said one. “Outside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.” However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often. Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project — variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop — were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple’s decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI’s job easier. The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation. Apple’s iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret.

Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall believes any commentary Apple gives about its Apple TV+ streaming service will be one of the most interesting points on Tuesday. “We continue to believe that Apple TV+ accounting will continue to boost Services revenue this year as iPhone and other product revenue is effectively reclassified into Services,” Hall wrote in a note on Monday. Apple TV+ is a streaming service stocked with Apple-backed TV shows, documentaries, and movies. Its list price is $4.99 per month, but Apple is bundling a free year with most of its gadgets. In September, Hall wrote that the way that Apple accounts for Apple TV+ might result in lower gross margins and profits. Apple responded to the Goldman note at the time, saying that it does “not expect the introduction of Apple TV+... to have a material impact on our financial results.” “As Apple starts to amortize original content creation (capex) costs through the P&L, the impact to Services profitability will be closely watched,” Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote last week. For the past two quarters, Apple executives have called attention to its wearables business, which includes Beats headphones, Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple doesn’t split it out separately -- it’s lumped into “Wearables, Home and Accessories,” which includes products like iPod touch, HomePods, and third-party accessories sold by Apple. Nonetheless, analysts will be watching it closely. “Potential upside to F1Q is most likely to come from Wearables, in our view,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty. For much of the December, Apple’s high-end AirPods Pro were hard to find, suggesting big demand or limited supply. In December, Citi analyst Jim Suva estimated that Apple could surpass $10 billion of quarterly wearables sales in the quarter. “We believe consensus is underappreciating the Apple Watch and Apple AirPods demand strength,” Suva wrote. However, Hall, the Goldman analyst, believes that investors are already expecting a big quarter from the segment. “We expect wearables, including both Airpods and Watch, to be positive headline generators, but we believe consensus is already baking in",error,513

We obviously couldn’t be prouder of our lineup and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn’t trade our position for anybody’s.” Consumers have held on to their iPhones for longer and longer recently — a trend Ives and others think 5G may help Apple reverse. Three years ago the average iPhone was used for 26 months to 28 months before replacement, Ives said, and now that is up to 37 months to 38 months. “5G will shorten or stablize replacement cycles,” CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Wednesday. “Which is needed, after a three-year decline in smartphone unit sales, in an industry that had never had a decline.″ The question, really, is how fast it can happen. Three big questions loom over the pace of 5G adoption. One is how rapidly infrastructure to provide the service, with its higher speeds and greater visual clarity, will be put in place, especially in the U.S. A second is how rapidly an ecosystem of applications, or apps, that use the greater capabilities can be brought to market, especially in areas like augmented reality, which offers more avenues in gaming and medical imaging, among other areas. And a third is what the souped-up phones will cost. Investors are more likely to see 5G develop into a major technology over three to five years than to witness a “supercycle” or iPhone upgrades beginning next fall, Zino says. He predicted that 5G will enable Apple to post low- to mid-single-digit percentage growth in iPhone unit sales beginning in fiscal 2021. “5G is a big deal, but some analysts may be making a bigger deal of it than they should,” he said. Apple hasn’t said how much the 5G iPhones will cost, and Ives put the number at about $1,500, versus $700 to $1,100 for the current generation of iPhone 11s.

We wanted to share a bit about how we’re carrying forward our commitment to care: how it’s informing our decision‑making, the significant steps we’re taking to keep everyone who visits one of our stores safe, and the ways in which our stores will look a little different. First, let’s remember how we got here. In China, and later around the world, we were one of the first companies to close our stores. In Greater China, we saw the importance of swift action — and the critical importance of social distance — to slow the virus’ spread. And, as time has gone on, we’ve continued to refine and expand our in‑store health and safety measures, which have proven so effective in places like Greater China, where our stores have been safely open for months. Our commitment is to only move forward with a reopening once we’re confident we can safely return to serving customers from our stores. We look at every available piece of data — including local cases, near and long‑term trends, and guidance from national and local health officials. These are not decisions we rush into — and a store opening in no way means that we won’t take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant. When a store in your area does take this step to reopen — which you can check up on using the Find a Store search tool — you’ll find the same helpful, dedicated teams that were there before we closed, but things may look and feel a little different. For one thing, you’ll find yourself with plenty of space. In every store, we’re focused on limiting occupancy and giving everybody lots of room, and renewing our focus on one‑on‑one, personalized service at the Genius Bar and throughout the store. We’re also taking some additional steps in most places. Face coverings will be required for all of our teams and customers, and we will provide them to customers who don’t bring their own. Temperature checks will be conducted at the door, and posted health questions will screen for those with symptoms — like cough or fever — or who have had recent exposure to someone infected with COVID‑19. Throughout the day, we’re conducting enhanced deep cleanings that place special emphasis on all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas. We’ve also taken this time to consider how we",error,513

The various data points to a rosier picture for Apple’s business in China, a very important market for the company. But analysts warn the Cupertino giant could face some headwinds in the next few months.  Apple released the second generation iPhone SE in mid-April which subsequently went on sale in China later that month. It starts at 3,299 yuan ($464) in the mainland.  CINNO Research said the iPhone SE accounted for 24% of all of Apple’s 3.9 million iPhone sales in April, despite only going on sale later in the month. IDC said the iPhone SE accounted for around 8% of shipments in April. But one analyst said that the figure may not necessarily reflect demand. “We see that the demand is not as strong as this supply,” Will Wong, research manager at IDC, told CNBC.  On top of that, there are concerns that the epidemic could deal a sharp blow to China’s economy for the rest of the year, which could impact consumer spending.  “It’s still tough. It’s tough not only for Apple but also all smartphone makers. For Apple it’s tough because right now, the economic situation is not so good and consumer sentiment has not fully returned to the normal levels,” Wong said.  He added that consumers may choose mid-to-low-range smartphone models. Apple has only one device in that category — the iPhone SE — whereas other vendors, such as Chinese phone-makers Xiaomi or Huawei, can cater to customers looking for cheaper handsets.  “Users previously may have considered to buy Apple but right now they may choose Huawei as they might get a phone with cheaper price and good features,” Wong said.  Meanwhile, smartphones with 5G connections have taken off in China after the country started rolling out its networks last year. These next-generation mobile networks promise super-fast data speeds.  A number of Chinese vendors including Huawei and Xiaomi have released 5G smartphones, but Apple has not unveiled one yet. This is important because 5G devices are expected to account for 40% of total smartphone sales in China in 2020, according to Counterpoint Research. If Apple does not launch a 5G phone, consumers could shop elsewhere for one, or hold off",error,513

On Alibaba-owned shopping site Tmall, revenue from Apple products totaled $136.9 million in May, according to WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China. That’s a 7.2% month-on-month rise.  Of course, Tmall is just one channel that Apple sells its products through. Others include Alibaba rival JD.com, as well as Apple’s own stores and bricks-and-mortar retailers.  But Apple is benefiting from signs of life in online retail sales in China.  “Apple’s growth in 2020 is staggering considering that these numbers include Covid-19 time,” WPIC CEO Jacob Cooke told CNBC. “Ultimately, it’s clear that Apple is a resilient company, and we’re keeping an eye on them to continue to grow over the back half of 2020.” Consumer spending on Apple’s App Store in China totaled $1.71 billion in May, up around 11% from the $1.53 billion recorded in April, according to data from Sensor Tower.  That money may not directly go to Apple’s top line, but it shows an increasing number of users continue to spend money via Apple’s platform.  The App Store is a key revenue driver for Apple’s increasingly important services business, which raked in over $46 billion in sales in the last fiscal year.  Part of the fall in shipments and sales for iPhones in China could have been due to consumers holding out for a 5G device. Apple is slated to release one this year, though some analysts are concerned there could be a delay.  Since China began rolling out its 5G networks last year, the popularity of devices able to connect to that generation of mobile infrastructure has been growing. In fact, 46.3% of total mobile phone shipments in China in May were 5G devices, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.  Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a recent note that he estimates around 350 million of Apple’s 950 million iPhones in use worldwide are ready for an upgrade to the new iPhone, adding the U.S. technology giant could see a “5",error,513
1382," a window into patients’ everyday lives, where they might move differently than in the lab or the clinic. But it’s still early days, and it’s too soon to say whether health developers will flock to incorporate the new metrics into their apps.  But some studies are currently underway to assess the role of wearables in monitoring patients’ mobility. The Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research is testing whether a mobile medical app called VascTrac that monitors movement using Apple devices can predict endovascular failure of patients with peripheral artery disease, which refers to a narrowing of peripheral arteries serving the legs, stomach, arms and head. “Think of it as a clinically validated way for us to know how you’re doing in the real world,” said Dr. Oliver Aalami, a vascular surgeon at Stanford University and a researcher behind the study. Where he sees Apple Watch or the iPhone playing a role is by providing doctors with an activity index of sorts, so they can check in on general declines in physical activity over periods of time. Wearables can play a particularly important role during the pandemic, he notes, because patients might prefer to perform such tests or exercises at home. Ideally, he’d like for the data generated from wearables to be used as part of a structured program, which is supervised by a doctor or exercise specialist. Dr. Jeffrey Wessler, a cardiologist based in New York, said he could see Apple Watch being particularly useful for monitoring how patients are faring during clinical trials. That’s because it could allow for researchers to measure participants asynchronously, and without extra resources to track how they’re responding to an intervention over time.  There’s also the potential for health systems to team up with Apple and strike deals with health plans willing to pay for exercise interventions down the road. There are even cases where patients can enroll in physical therapy in lieu of needing a surgical procedure. In the Netherlands, for instance, exercise therapy programs are covered for vascular patients with peripheral artery disease. Vascular surgeon Joep Teijink told CNBC by phone say that patients after six weeks of physical therapy are seeing promising results, and many do not require a procedure. Teijink said he’s still determining how wearables can play a role in helping these patients.  In the United States, Dr. Aalami said that integrated health systems are most likely to be investing in exercise therapy programs using wearable devices because",error,513

The company researched all kinds of sleep tracking, including to record brain waves via an EEG, over the years, and determined that it’s very challenging to measure “a complete picture of what’s going on in the brain” with just a wrist-worn device.  In addition, Apple doesn’t typically like to give bad news to its users, including that they aren’t sleeping properly. So the company has provided very minimal data about sleep duration and sleep quality. It’s possible to see periods of wakefulness and sleep, but not the most detailed information around sleep cycles. Instead, Apple asks Apple Watch wearers to set a goal around how much sleep they’d like to get, and then nudges them to wind down before they go to bed. Ultimately, Lynch said, it’s about tapping into user psychology. “We wanted to be seen as a helpful addition, rather than another source of frustration and anxiety,” he said. “We try to take the broad ideas of what is possible and hone it down as simply as we can, and then try to simplify it some more.” Apple’s former sleep czar, Roy Raymann, who is now the chief scientific officer at sleep tech company SleepScore Labs, agreed with that approach. “In general, consumers are looking for tools to improve, not for tools to measure,” he said. For example, Raymann said that stepping on a bathroom scale isn’t going to help a person lose weight tomorrow. In the same way, overloading a person with data about their hours of rapid eye movement sleep might not help them sleep better. “So [Apple] focused on the measurement as a way to hit sleep health goal behaviors, which is a holistic view I support,” Raymann said. One of the new features involves a setting called Wind Down, which is designed to help users get to bed earlier. The idea is that people can set up a bedtime routine with their watch, including using a meditation app while the screen darkens and notifications are muted.  In the morning, the Apple Watch has a silent vibrating alarm or can make quiet sounds to wake up the user slowly.  Apple’s Lynch said that the company put a lot of thought into Wind Down because it got consistent feedback from users that their biggest challenge was bedtime. �",error,513
1389," apiece as of Wednesday, trimming its 2020 losses to about 15%. The stock tumbled nearly 20% in the first quarter.  Berkshire’s stock portfolio had been concentrated in financials and consumer plays before the conglomerate dipped its toes in technology. Consequently, Buffett had missed out on Big Tech’s massive run that drove the last bull market.  Now, the billionaire investor calls Apple Berkshire’s “third-largest business,” after its insurance and railroad interests. Buffett previously said iPhone is a “sticky” product, keeping people within the company’s ecosystem. “It’s probably the best business I know in the world,” Buffett said in a CNBC interview in February. “I don’t think of Apple as a stock. I think of it as our third business.” Berkshire also owned 533,300 shares of Amazon as of the end of the first quarter, now worth more than $1.6 billion. One of Buffett’s deputies — Todd Combs or Ted Weschler — made the bet on the e-commerce giant in 2019. Buffett raised eyebrows a few months ago when he revealed he dumped the entirety of his airline investments, worth north of $4 billion, because of the fundamental change to the industry caused by the coronavirus.  It was a rare move for the buy-and-hold investor who received criticism for taking a big loss for this trade. Berkshire exited its airline stake before the shares’ massive rebound as the economy reopened partially. United and American Airlines rallied more than 20% each last month alone, while Delta Air Lines jumped over 10% in June. However the comeback has stalled lately and the shares are still way off from their old highs, in some cases by more than half. So Buffett could still be right about the airlines as investments. And in reality, the loss from the airline trade pales in comparison to Berkshire’s huge return from Apple so far. “The challenge for Buffett is — are we in a financial euphoria episode and is Apple going to get sucked down?” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. Many on Wall Street have issued dire warnings on megacap technology companies, comparing their sky-high valuations and recent rally to the episode before the burst of the tech bubble in 2001. Buffett did avoid the dot-com buildup",error,513

[W]e need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost.” After that, Amazon ended up buying Quidsi for about $500 million. Amazon shut down Quidsi almost seven years later. Quidsi didn’t have much of a chance to make it on its own due to the pricing pressure caused by its larger competitor Amazon. As for Facebook, the documents show that its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 was at least in part due to Zuckerberg’s desire to quash a buzzy and growing competitor. (Zuckerberg argued in his testimony Wednesday that there was no guarantee Instagram would be a success back then, and that its position today as a dominant social media app is because it had Facebook’s endless resources to work with.) But in emails with then-CFO David Ebersman, Zuckerberg discussed the advantages of buying Instagram. Zuckerberg agreed with Ebersman that acquiring Instagram would help “neutralize a potential competitor.”  “Instagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business,” Zuckerberg wrote in another email released Wednesday. That plays right into one of the remedies that have been proposed against Facebook: Split the company up by separating Facebook from other major apps it has acquired, Instagram and WhatsApp. That’s just a taste. There are plenty more documents that were released Wednesday to dig through. They’ll make a great beach read for any antitrust dorks out there.  Even if you’re not confident that the House antitrust subcommittee’s upcoming report on the four giants will lead to any passable legislation by a fractured and bitter Congress, we now have fresh insight into Big Tech’s dealings behind the scenes as the four giants grew into dominant forces in the global economy over the last decade. And it doesn’t end with Congress. The DOJ, FTC and groups of state attorneys general are all investigating these four companies to varying degrees. Those investigations are more likely to result in immediate action without waiting for Congress, which has yet to pass a single piece of significant tech regulation since the “techlash” began a few years ago. As expected, Wednesday’s hearing made for some spectacular political theater with no substance. But the government has the goods on Apple, Amazon, Facebook",error,513
1417," music in different rooms, or the same song in some or all rooms. Apple packs in a bunch of other fun features. There’s an intercom option that lets you broadcast a message to anyone in your family, so long as they have an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch or their own HomePod Mini. It’s useful if you want to tell the whole house dinner is ready, and I like that messages went to my other Apple devices even if I was home or not. You just get a little audio notification on your watch or phone that you can tap and play back, which is great since it won’t automatically just play that message if you’re in a meeting. The Amazon Echo and Google Nest speakers have similar features. I also really like that I can start playing a song on my iPhone and tap the HomePod Mini and it’ll start playing on the speaker. Or a song can start on the speaker and I can walk by and transfer it to the iPhone with another tap. Apple will release an update in the coming months that will improve the hand-off experience with vibration and colors so it feels more like a song is moving from one device to another. I like some of the added smarts in the latest HomePod software update, which is also available for the regular HomePod. You can ask for a personal update by saying “Hey Siri, what’s my update?” and it’ll read off your calendar events, the weather, traffic to your appointments, reminders and then a news briefing. I like that, although Google and Amazon let you do the same thing but let you customize your news source and what the digital assistant reads you. Another new feature called “Web Answers” that displays the results of questions you ask on your phone. So, if you ask something like “show me pictures of Rome” it will show pictures of Rome on your iPhone. I also liked the tie-in with Apple Maps. When I asked the HomePod Mini how long it’ll take to get to my in-laws’ beach house, CarPlay will recommend directions to that place when I got in the car. I have about a dozen lights and other smart gadgets around my house synced up with Apple Home, the app on iPhones, iPads and Macs that lets you control them with Siri or through an app. The HomePod Mini works well as a hub if you want to control gadgets when you’re away from",error,513
1417," home, and I like that I can just speak to it to turn off my lights at night. But this works just as well on an iPhone or on the iPad/Apple TV, which also work as a Home hub. The real strength of the HomePod Mini is that it taps into lots of Apple’s apps on your iPhone, which means iPhone owners will get the most out of it. You can ask Siri to add to your Notes app, for example, set reminders and tasks that sync with your phone, make and receive calls, find your lost iPhone or Apple Watch, send and receive iMessages and get news briefing from the News app. Those apps aren’t available for the Google Nest Audio or Alexa, though similar ones are. It’s just convenient if you already use them. While you can use other services like Spotify to AirPlay Music to the HomePod, so far only Pandora has added support that lets you set it as the default option instead of Apple Music. So, you can change that setting and just say “Hey Siri, play music by Led Zeppelin” and it’ll play from Pandora instead of Apple Music. That’s a bummer for folks who pay for Spotify or other services that haven’t added this support yet, though. The Amazon Echo and Google Nest Audio offer support for lots of default music services. I wish I could set more apps as the default service on the HomePod Mini. While the HomePod Mini is good for Apple users, and Siri has gotten a lot better in recent years, you can still do more with an Amazon Echo or Google Nest Hub. The Echo lets you buy stuff from Amazon, for example, or control your Amazon Fire TV. I’d like to see Apple add support for controlling the Apple TV from a HomePod Mini by voice, so that I could just ask it to start playing a movie or TV show. But you can’t do that. The Google Nest Hub, as you might expect, ties better into Google services like Calendar and Maps, and has a smarter voice assistant since it taps into Google Search and knows a lot more about you if you regularly use Google services. But, if you’re like me, you may use Siri or Google Assistant or Alexa to ask the weather or a sports score most of the time, and Siri can do that just fine. At the $99 price point, I also think the Nest Audio and Amazon Echo sound better. As I mentioned",error,513

It offers improved performance so it feels faster. Apple says frequently visited websites will load 50% faster than Google Chrome. One of my favorite features lets you preview an open website by hovering your mouse over an open tab. It shows you a small sample of the site that’s open so you know what you’re clicking into and if it’s the tab you’re looking for. Safari is also getting extensions in the App Store. These are the tiny apps that other browsers such as Chrome already offer that can let you do things on a website. Pocket is one widget I use in Chrome, for example, which lets me save stories to read later. Safari has a bunch of other updates that are on iPhone and iPad, too, such as new privacy reports so you can see how websites use your information, alerts if your password may have been obtained in a security breach and more. MacOS Big Sur includes a big Maps refresh, too. It’s, again, much more like Maps on iPhone and iPad, with cycling routes, a 3D “Look Around” feature that’s like Google Street View, indoor maps and options to create certain guides before you visit a city. A guide, for example, can let you save a list of restaurants or sites to see when you travel, and that list is then synced right onto your iPhone or iPad. Maps also includes new routes for electric vehicles that show you charging stations after you’ve synced your car with your iPhone. One of the other new changes in macOS Big Sur is support for iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to own one of the new Macs Apple introduced earlier this week to run them. New models include the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with Apple’s M1 chip, which replaces Intel chips in previous-generation Macs. It’s this chip that allows you to run the iPhone and iPad apps, so you won’t be able to if you have an older Mac. The M1 Macs will be released next week. There are a lot of other features, such as updates to Siri for web search, new weather notifications, including if it will rain soon or if severe weather is expected, better search across your whole computer and added controls for your smart home. MacOS Big Sur is supported by: You can",error,513
1419,"K video without any hiccups I'd normally see on the previous-generation MacBook Air with an Intel chip. I ran a few software tests just to see how much faster the new MacBook is and if it met some of Apple's claims. Using software that measures the power of the processor, called Geekbench, I found the new MacBook Air to be twice as fast as the Intel-based equivalent model at some tasks and more than three times as fast at others. I repeated these tests in some real-world environments, like in the game Shadow of the Tomb Raider. I don't think folks normally think of Macs as gaming systems, but Apple's website says the game runs 3.5 times faster than the MacBook Air. That's true: the old MacBook Air can barely run the game while the new MacBook Air can run it fine and on higher graphics settings. That game is 2 years old, though, so I still wouldn't think of the Mac as a powerhouse compared with laptops with dedicated graphics chips from Nvidia or AMD. But, it's more powerful than the Intel's embedded graphics. Apps open quickly, too, but are more on par with the MacBook Air from earlier this year. I didn't notice any sort of slowdown even when I had lots of tabs open in the browser and about a dozen different apps open. The new MacBook Air has longer battery life than the Intel models, too, despite the faster chip. I turned it on at 9:15 a.m. and still had 28% at 6:12 p.m. after using it most of the day, running benchmarks and watching a nearly two-hour movie in 1080p. Apple promises up to 18 hours of battery life if you're just watching a movie, versus 12 hours on the last MacBook Air. But how you use your computer will drastically change the battery life. I think most folks will get a full day. It's really quiet, too, since there's no fan inside to kick on while you're in the middle of work. But that comes at a cost: the bottom gets pretty hot. The chip change does not break any old apps -- at least the ones I use -- you can still run the ones that were designed for older Macs. I was able to download and open a bunch of apps from third parties that weren't built for M1, like Spotify, Cisco AnyConnect, Geekbench and Google Chrome. They worked just fine. New versions of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator optimized for M1 chips are coming later. The",error,513
1419," M1 chip also lets the MacBook Air run some iPhone and iPad apps, but a lot of app makers have opted out from having their apps published. I found some apps I use regularly on my iPhone, like the calorie-counting app ""Lose It,"" CNBC and HBO Max, but there aren't apps for Instagram, any of Google's products, Netflix or Hulu, which is kind of a bummer. Also, the iPhone and iPad apps that do work on the new Mac are fairly limited -- you can't make HBO Max full screen, for example. Moreover, most of these apps are designed around a touch screen, so unless Apple adds one to a future Mac, this feature is mostly a novelty and an easy way to use apps that otherwise weren't available on Mac. On a strict design level, there's not much ""wow"" factor here. The new MacBook Air still looks and feels exactly like the last MacBook Air, just with a faster processor, better screen, support for iPhone/iPad apps and longer battery life. Those are great improvements, but they probably aren't going to drive a lot of upgrades in the short term. The M1 MacBook Air only supports one external monitor instead of two like on the last MacBook Air. I use two additional screens every day, so people who have a similar work flow might be upset about this. Also, while the 720p webcam offers sharper and clearer video thanks to additional smarts from the M1, it's still a lower resolution than what you'll find on other computers, like the Microsoft Surface, which has a 5MP camera. It's fine for FaceTime, though. I also couldn't test every app out there in the week or so I had with the new MacBook Air. So there may be apps that don't run properly on the new M1 chip yet. Your mileage may vary, though all of the apps I use for work and play ran fine. I am also a little peeved that I spent $999 on a MacBook Air back in March only to have it replaced by a faster model with a better screen and more apps just eight months later. I guess that's the pace of technology, but it still stings for people like me who expect a new product to be state-of-the-art for at least a year before it's replaced. I tested the $999 MacBook Air and think it's a great buy for the price if you need a new computer. I was pretty blown away by how powerful it felt compared with Intel models",error,513

Bottle Rocket has developed mobile apps for companies like Southwest, Capital One, and its clients include CNBC parent company, NBCUniversal, Disney, and Marriott. Ware said he built a room with more than 300 cameras to film himself doing more than 700 exercises for the app. D2W can create different “warmups, activations, and a recovery program that is specifically for the user.” “It’s using artificial intelligence,” Ware said. “The more you use it, the smarter it gets, and the more advanced it grows with you as go along the process. It’s like having a real trainer in your hand.” Ware said D2W has augmented reality capabilities that shows enhanced 3-D models and detailed instructions of “how you should do the exercise, the tempos and what other variables you need whether it’s how much weight or time and attention you need on that muscle.” Ware added a voice capture feature that syncs with the Apple Watch and is able to suggest workout levels and rest periods based on a user’s breathing. He said D2W provides a “personalized experience” similar to an actual real-life trainer. “The personalized engagement is one of the biggest keys that I was trying to get out of this,” Ware said. “Because when you go to a trainer, you’re getting the personalized engagement that keeps you coming back. I want that same thing for this app.” Driven to Win has three subscription options: $14.99 per month, $74.99 for six months, or $99.99 for the entire year. Ware said he wants to add more features to the app in 2021. He’s also seeking a Series B funding round for roughly $30 million for expansion options, eyeing “acquisitions and other pieces of tech” as smaller firms weakened by Covid-19 could be available to acquire.   “I’m trying to shake up the fitness space with something different that is not the same content,” Ware said.

1430," My favorites so far are the cycling instructors Emily Fayette, Bakari Williams and Tyrell Desean, but I haven’t taken a class with all the 21 instructors for a variety of workouts yet. There are a lot to choose from with classes like high-intensity interval training (HIIT), spin, yoga, treadmill, rowing, strength and dance. I love that Fitness+ syncs seamlessly with the Apple Watch. You just pick the workout you want and then hit start. Your heart rate, the time elapsed (or time left if you want) and your Apple Watch Fitness rings (red for calories, green for exercise minutes and blue for standing minutes) appear on the screen and close as you continue to work out. Any Apple Watch owner knows how addictive it can be to try to close all of your rings every day, and I like that the app puts this right on the screen to encourage me to close mine. You can stream workouts to your iPad, iPhone or Apple TV, or download them for when you don’t have an internet connection. I preferred cycling with an iPad, but liked that I could come upstairs and do a cooldown or a quick yoga class while watching on the Apple TV. Also, as long as you own an Apple Watch and subscribe to Fitness+, you can workout on any Apple TV with Fitness+ installed. So, if you’re staying in a hotel that has one, or more likely an Airbnb, it’ll see your watch nearby and let you take classes even if the owner of the Apple TV doesn’t pay for Fitness+. This will be fun when we can all travel again. It’s also easy to find classes on the Apple TV, iPad or iPhone. The app recommends classes based on your previous workouts (including in any app that saves data to Apple Health, like Peloton). You can filter by time (10 minutes up to 45 minutes), by instructor, by exercise or by type of music. And, I like that you can automatically save music or play it back inside the Apple Music app. You don’t need to be a subscriber to Apple Music to hear songs in Fitness+, however. The workouts are great. The 45-minute bike rides definitely left me sweaty and showed that I burned about 450 to 500 calories, about what I get in the same time from the Peloton app. I’m not a huge yoga guy, but I liked the 10-minute intro class and plan to try to take some of the",error,513
1430," longer ones. I really need to work on my flexibility. A 10-minute strength class I snuck in after a bike ride really worked out my thighs. There’s plenty to choose from already and more classes will be added each Monday. You’ll find enough to do. Finally, and maybe the most important part, is Apple Fitness does a great job of encouraging all fitness levels. There are additional instructors during each workout showing recommended tweaks or changes you might make if you’re not in perfect shape like the trainers. In the cycling workouts, I was encouraged to push myself but not to set a specific level of resistance or cadence, which I liked better than on Peloton where I first felt like I wasn’t working out as hard if I couldn’t maintain the harder resistance levels. And speaking of inclusion, the classes all start and end with a bit of sign language for people who are hard of hearing. Nice touch. There are a couple of things I still prefer from the Peloton app. Apple’s Fitness+ instructors are great, but I want to learn more about them and their individual personalities. I like that Peloton instructor Toussaint serves as a sort of drill sergeant-style instructor. No excuses for not doing your best. This extends even into the music. You’ll hear explicit language in Peloton. (Even the instructors curse occasionally.) You don’t get that in Fitness+. Maybe it’s weird, but I just don’t get as amped working to a hip-hop playlist with the curse words missing. And I like that Peloton instructors chat more about their lives and experiences. Peloton’s Lovewell talks about being raised on Martha’s Vineyard. Massachusetts. Her dad was a musician. She talks about her favorite new tunes with custom workout playlists. About how she’s restoring a new home. I don’t yet know a whole lot about Fitness+ instructors, aside from small profiles posted online, but I’m told that should start to come through more and I’m looking forward to more of that. Peloton also offers live classes while Fitness+ does not. And if you don’t take the live class, Peloton still shows you who’s taking the prerecorded class with you at the same time, which I like.

It’s fun in cycling classes, but I wish there were more social features that showed me who else was riding in real time, or how my friends did in a specific class. It doesn’t show any user names (that’s by design as a privacy feature) and instructors don’t shout out encouragements for hitting milestones like a 100th ride or workout. I just love the community feel in Peloton and themed classes like the holiday and Thanksgiving rides where instructors might even dress up or play holiday music. I hope that comes to Fitness+ too. Also, while the Apple Watch has a bunch of digital badges and awards you can win for workout streaks, I wish there were some dedicated to Fitness+. So, maybe I’d get badges for working out with Fitness+ in a week. Or a badge for doing specific holiday workouts if and when those ever appear. Finally, it’s obvious, but you need Apple devices to use Fitness+. It doesn’t run on Android or TV boxes like Roku, and you have to have an Apple Watch. So, Peloton is the way to go if you want an app that runs on different kinds of TV boxes, tablets, phones and fitness trackers. Fitness+ is excellent. Should you pick it over Peloton? Tough call. This is the part of a review is where I’d normally say if you should buy something or not, but both Fitness+ and the Peloton app come with free one-month trials. And anyone who bought a new Apple Watch this year gets a three-month trial. So, really, you should try both and see which one you like better. I’m pretty torn right now. I love how well Fitness+ syncs and works across devices, how well it works with the Apple Watch and that it’s really inviting for all fitness levels. You’ll end Peloton and Fitness+ classes feeling sweaty and happy. Considering I used to pay more than $150 a month for a gym before the coronavirus pandemic, I’m probably just going to keep using both apps. Apple Fitness+ is included in the Premier family plan I already pay for, and I like being able to switch up instructors and workout styles between the apps. The way I see it, I’m just getting even more classes if I subscribe to both. Plus, this way I’",error,513
1433," announcing the change, says Eric Seufert, an analyst and owner of website Mobile Dev Memo. “After some of that time, some of them have been combined, so the picture is a little clearer.” But he said Apple was still slow at first about any kinds of clarifications.  “In the absence of clarity and instruction from Apple, the ad tech industry just ran away with these insane fantasies about how they were going to be able to sidestep this,” Seufert said. He said many companies didn’t make any progress in the course of months where they didn’t have clear enough direction. Apple did issue a number of clarifications this fall about what would not be allowed.  Apple declined to comment on its communication with the industry or on other specific questions about the guidelines and how they should be interpreted.  After a slew of complaints, Apple ultimately decided to delay enforcement of the changes, which were supposed to go into effect with the release of iOS 14 in September. The rules will now go into effect early next year, giving industry players more time to make their apps and methods compliant. The fact that users will need to opt in to sharing their IDFA to have apps track them will likely mean low opt-in rates. As a result, advertisers would have much less of that definitive data to work with. That’s led some in the industry to ponder whether players could use other methods to determine the identity of users or their devices to target that advertising or link behavior like a download to advertising. But Apple has indicated some of those methods won’t comply with the rules. And if tech players do track without permission, that means bad news for the apps they work with. Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said last week that starting in 2021, Apple will remove apps from its App Store that track users in ways that could be shared with other companies without receiving permission from the user. The changes may still be full of intricacies and question marks, but with such severe consequences, some are erring far on the side of caution.  Mike Brooks, SVP of revenue at WeatherBug, wrote recently about how much responsibility app publishers have in the post-IDFA world. He said publishers bear the entire risk of iOS 14 violations, with severe punishments like App Store removal on the table. Many in the ad industry had expected an IDFA change as tech companies have recently focused on privacy as a feature of their products",error,513
1433,". Nevertheless, when it was announced at Apple’s WWDC event in June, the industry started assembling their Plan B’s.  For one, industry players said they expect an abysmal rate of people opting in to share their IDFA when prompted to do so by an app. “When you look at how Apple is actually implementing the popups with iOS 14, you’d have to be insane to opt into advertising personalization and tracking,” said Ana Milicevic, principal and co-founder of management consultancy Sparrow Advisers. Companies have been trying to figure out how to communicate with users before that prompt to show users how valuable opting in is for the company. But there are some methods Apple won’t allow. The company has said developers can’t try to incentivize users to agree to allow tracking, and they also can’t say the app is functional only if they agree.  And if opt-in rates are indeed small, companies that make money through apps won’t be able to use that data in more granular ways. Apple has its own solution for digital advertisers who feel like they’re out of options. The company recently revamped its “SKAdNetwork,” which will be available for advertisers through Apple. But it won’t provide data that’s as granular as what they’ve received before, and as it stands many advertisers aren’t keen on what it can offer.  “Apple has almost withdrawn its support to third-party ad monetization without offering a solid replacement to publishers and marketers,” Sergio Serra, a product manager at mobile adtech company InMobi, said in an email to CNBC. “While SKAdNetwork is a good attempt to mitigate the issue, it cannot be a scalable response as it lacks many important aspects.” Facebook, for instance, said in August that in testing it saw more than a 50% drop in publisher revenue through its Audience Network, which allows mobile software developers to provide in-app ads targeted on Facebook data, when personalization was removed from mobile app ad install campaigns.  Facebook has also accused Apple with its iOS changes of moving the free, ad-supported internet into paid apps and services, where Apple can take its 30% cut, and crushing small businesses’ ability to do personalized advertising. The broader marketing industry has also pushed back. A global group of marketing leaders wrote a letter this summer to",error,513
1433," the company about their concerns, including competitive issues posed by the change, as well as asking for the company to work in collaboration with the industry to come up with standards. Another group, the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media that combines a number of top ad trade groups, asked Apple in its own letter for a meeting to address the changes and answer questions. The group had a preliminary meeting with Apple, but industry parties were still hoping for more commitments from the company, Travis Clinger, SVP of addressability and ecosystem at LiveRamp, which is a member of the Partnership, said last week. One major theme for the ad industry is the potential impact on companies that offer free apps supported by advertising. Though consumers may be annoyed by ads, would they be willing to shell out money to use every app they use? And if not, will those apps survive? Apple’s Federighi responded to “outlandish” claims in last week’s speech, saying that companies were making false arguments to maintain the “privacy-invasive status quo.”  It all comes alongside a broader march toward more consumer privacy. Google is making a huge change of removing support for third-party cookies in its Chrome browser, which are used to track users across multiple sites to target ads and see how they perform. Some in the industry also expect Google to follow Apple with its own mobile advertising identifier on Android devices next year. Google declined to comment on the potential of changes to that identifier.  The change leaves app developers and the companies that help those developers make money through ads to figure out how to pivot or risk the future of their business. Several industry players told CNBC they have hoped for more clarity from Apple, while some have turned to industry Slack groups to piece together answers by communicating with competitors.  Some methods clearly won’t fly. When Apple first announced the change at its WWDC event in June, it suggested that it would limit fingerprinting, a method that can be used to track users and target ads to them as they browse the internet and use apps. “But then they let these ad tech companies tell their clients, ‘We’re going to be able to fingerprint,’ and spread that message,” Seufert said. “It muddied people’s understanding of what was going to be allowed.” Seufert said he believes most companies today understand fingerprinting won’t be allowed.  Certain methods that",error,513
1433," use signals from a consumer’s phone to measure or analyze but aren’t strictly referred to as fingerprinting can get into a grayer area. Apple says in its policies that companies can’t derive data from a device for the purpose of uniquely identifying it. Some in the ad industry see any potential workaround that could still identify a device as a potential violation of Apple’s new policies. But some players say they are still trying to identify devices with methods that are privacy-conscious enough or anonymous enough to follow the guidelines. Some industry players say their methods will comply with Apple guidelines because they are only using that data for their clients and aren’t selling that data or using it for other purposes, or because they’re using algorithms to examine broader campaigns and not specific users. It’s still unclear how Apple will police those methods, leaving the window open for companies attempting any kind of workaround to face consequences or pushback from Apple. InMobi’s Serra said while Apple wants to regulate and enforce new policies, it can basically only control what happens on the platform, like the IDFA. But when it comes to information like IP or carrier-level data, that may go beyond their jurisdiction.  “Since they realize they cannot enforce directly such practices, a psychological Reign of Terror is starting to materialize within the ecosystem,” Serra said. He added that advertising platforms are afraid of going against Apple’s wishes for fear of being banned by the App Store or Apple’s own SKADNetwork program.   Data company LiveRamp is using a different method, what it calls its “Authenticated Traffic Solution,” which it says involves consumers opting in to gain control of their data, and on the other side, brands and publishers being able to use that data. That solution can use encrypted emails or phone numbers that allow publishers to connect their own first-party data. Apple says if someone has not opted into tracking, a hidden email address or phone number can’t be used to track that user. But LiveRamp says its solution doesn’t use device data or let any data to be mapped from the device to a consumer “identity.” Some players in the ecosystem are looking at new ways of forging ahead amid the change.  WeatherBug’s Brooks said his company is looking to the future, investing in areas like direct sales, ways of leveraging first-party data and contextual advertising. Some companies",error,513
1436," last week with Facebook’s two-day campaign against Apple. The ads called foul on an impending change to the iPhone’s operating system designed to alert you when an app will track your personal data like location and browsing history, which companies like Facebook use to target their ads. The alert gives you the option to block the tracking before using the app. Facebook claimed that Apple’s move is designed to crush small businesses that rely on that targeted advertising to reach their customers online. It also warned -- without evidence -- that Apple’s move would force app makers to stop offering free, ad-supported apps to their customers. Instead, they would have to charge customers through digital subscriptions or other fees. Conveniently for Apple, it takes a cut of transactions conducted through its platform, including purchases or subscriptions that users make through apps they download on its App Store. Facebook painted a devious picture of Apple in the campaign: Here’s a company with complete control over the rules of its platform, making a change designed to squeeze small businesses and force them into a paid model, of which Apple will take a cut. Facebook delivered that messaging in newspaper ads, blog posts, Instagram posts and a glitzy website featuring small business owners who use Facebook to advertise. Apple pushed back on Facebook’s accusations. The company said the pop-up you’ll see in apps is only designed to let you know when and how an app plans to track you, not ban tracking altogether. App makers like Facebook also have room in the pop-up and other screens to make their case to you for why you should allow tracking. Apps are still free to collect all the data on you that they were before, but you’ll have to give them deliberate permission to do so. According to Apple, it’s just the latest in a string of privacy-centric features it has added to products over the years. The roots of the squabble stretch back more than a decade. In the iPhone’s infancy, there was a great debate over what the mobile internet should look like. Would it look the internet on a desktop PC, where people mostly used a mobile web browser to visit websites, with everything built on openly published standards? Or would users switch between a collection of internet-connected software “apps,” giving more control to the companies that owned the mobile platforms? Facebook, which was born on the open internet, favored the former option and pushed for rich web apps written to emerging standards",error,513
1436,". But it lost the fight in large part because of Apple, which pushed the app model as the default way of accomplishing tasks on the iPhone, then insisted that its own App Store would be the only legal and easy way to find and install those apps. (Google smartly played both sides, investing in the Android mobile platform and its own Google Play app store, as well as building out its Chrome web browser and exercising influence over web standards.) As the future became clear, Facebook made attempts to build its own smartphone so it wouldn’t have to concede so much control to Apple or Google. The device never saw the light of day, and Facebook instead developed a software “skin” for Android devices that featured its own services. That was also a flop. Today, Facebook is laying the groundwork to own the next major computing platform so it doesn’t have to play by another company’s rules again. That’s why it’s currently developing products like digital glasses, which the company is expected to launch in 2021. In the meantime, Facebook has to deal with Apple. It’s ironic that Facebook accused Apple of abusing its market power last week, just days after the FTC and a group of state attorneys general sued Facebook, alleging antitrust violations and recommending a breakup of the company. On top of that, Facebook’s argument exposed its own hold on the digital ads market. Small businesses wouldn’t have to rely so much on Facebook if Facebook had a viable competitor for these companies to advertise through. Apple faces similar government scrutiny, although there have been no formal antitrust lawsuits. In October, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust released an epic report on the “monopoly power” of the four biggest tech giants, alleging Apple uses its control of the App Store to squash potential competitors. Both companies have rejected claims that their businesses violate antitrust laws. But Facebook has now created an environment where two giants facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and around the world are trading barbs over which one is more guilty when it comes to abuse of market power. It’s also hard to tell what Facebook’s end game is here. Apple is not going to backtrack on a key privacy feature for the iPhone, and Facebook is not going to risk losing millions of users by yanking its apps off the App Store. Steve Satterfield, Facebook’s director of privacy and public policy, told CNBC this week that the company will still comply with Apple�",error,513
1439," $50 million — is on a much different scale from what REvil has operated on in the past. Thirty-one percent of the companies attacked by the group have been in professional services, not technology, Arete found. Nineteen percent have been in health care, and 16% in manufacturing. The average ransom demand has also been much lower in the past, Arete found, at just under $728,000. After negotiations over the price, the average ransom actually paid is even lower than that: Just over $129,000. It’s a remarkably business-like operation, complete with customer service desks, software support teams and even a Craigslist-style marketplace to recruit new hackers to the enterprise. Bleicher provided CNBC with one jobs posting for REvil that he found on the dark web. Written in Russian, it says: “We have 1 position for a person that gains accesses to networks, that already have active accesses. Monday we’ll announce one of our largest attacks. ​We work 24x7. We are stable. We make money — a lot of money. We are waiting for you in our direct message.” Charles Carmakal, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said his rough estimate is the gang has collected a total of $100 million so far. That means a $50 million ransom would be an enormous step up for the group. But everything in this criminal underworld is negotiable. “I have seen other organizations being asked for $50 million,” Carmakal said. “Nobody really realistically pays that much money. They’ll try to negotiate it down to a number that is a little bit more reasonable and doable if they do decide to pay.” Carmakal said the huge ransom demand and high-profile target in this case may be more about getting attention — and scaring future victims — than it is about this one case. One possibility is the high-profile taunting and ransom note were only made public after a private negotiation that didn’t end well from the hacker’s point of view. So now they’re leveraging that for publicity and intimidation. “These groups tend to amplify their messages and try to coerce victims, usually after they don’t feel like the victim is willing to pay,” Carmakal said. But why are companies sending these huge payments to criminal gangs at all? Carmakal said firms look",error,513
1443," really cool benefits to the chip. Apple added a new wide-angle camera to the front of both of the new iPad Pros. It enables a feature called Center Stage, which follows you around as you’re talking on FaceTime, WebEx or any other video app that decides to use it. It’s awesome. I called my wife once, and my editor another time, and the camera zoomed out or in and followed me as I walked back and forth around the room. It’s similar to the functionality built into competing products like the Facebook Portal. Speaking of cameras, you also get two cameras on the back, including an ultra-wide angle lens that’s fun for capturing more in a scene. There’s also the lidar camera we saw last year, which helps for augmented reality experiences. You can just start dropping digital objects on top of the real world in apps that support augmented reality, instead of waiting for the iPad to scan the room. I don’t use lidar or AR very much, but it’s really useful to have if you’re doing a home project and want to use it to measure, see how new furniture might fit in a room, and so on. Apps like Procreate let industrial designers create 3D models and then drop digital models in the real world to see how they might look in person, too. I said this last year, and I’ll say it again: The $349 Magic Keyboard makes a huge difference for people who want to work from an iPad. It adds a great trackpad, a really good keyboard that’s easy to type on, and turns the iPad into more of a laptop-hybrid. I still use a MacBook Air for most things, since I’m more productive switching between apps on macOS, but the Magic Keyboard is worth buying if you just need a tablet that serves as an occasional laptop. I just really like the versatility: I can go from working on this review outside in the backyard to lounging on the couch at night reading the news on a big screen, the latter of which isn’t as comfortable with a laptop. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a big feature the regular new 11-inch model doesn’t have: a “Liquid Retina XDR” display, which is fancy branding for using mini LEDs. This technology enables a much brighter screen for certain things, like watching HDR movies. I also found it",error,513
1443," looked brighter outside in direct sunlight than my 2018 11-inch iPad Pro. The brightness of the 11-inch iPad Pro caps out at 600 nits. That’s the same for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in most apps, but it has peak full screen brightness for things like HDR video of 1,000 nits, and individual mini LEDs can get as bright as 1,600 nits. That’s a little in the weeds, but it means brighter areas in a video or photo, or the difference between say a really bright sun in deep black space. By comparison, the new iMac has 500 nits of brightness, so this is a feature professional video and photo editors will appreciate on a portable device. The designs-for-pros trend continues to the charging port, which now supports Thunderbolt / USB 4 for faster data transfers if you’re dumping a bunch of movies or photos from a camera, for example. It supports up to 6K external displays if you want to connect it to a monitor and up to 10 Gbps Ethernet connections if you want to hardwire into your router for faster internet. Again, most folks might not use this — I don’t — but it’s there for the people who need it. It supports the $99 Apple Pencil, which I use every now and then to jot down notes or write to search in apps (which works surprisingly well). Power users will find it useful for finely tuning or cropping parts of picture or video, especially when poking a finger at the screen isn’t precise and when you want to use it as a tablet instead of a laptop. The speakers haven’t changed, but they’re still really good, offering surround sound from both sides of the iPad Pro. The new iPad Pro supports 5G if you pay for the cellular model, about a $200 upgrade. 5G isn’t a huge deal yet, but it’s starting to become more prevalent around the U.S. and it’s great future-proofing for when you can download and upload movies, videos, files and more much faster. I didn’t have a great Verizon 5G signal at home, though, so I mostly just stuck with Wi-Fi, but I’m excited to use it for streaming Xbox games anywhere there’s a good signal, which I loved playing on the iPad over Wi-Fi. The battery easily lasted me through a full",error,513
1443," day, but that could extend to several days on lighter usage or under a day if you’re working on a 5G cellular connection with max brightness.  It’s not cheap. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro, without a keyboard or cellular connectivity, starts at $1,099. A comparable MacBook Air starts at $999. Add in 5G and the Magic Keyboard keyboard and you’re going to spend $1,648 — and that’s for the minimum 128GB of storage. Boost the storage and you could easily spend more than $2,000. I totally see the portability benefits and know there are different use cases for the MacBook Air and an iPad Pro. But it’s one reason why I think the iPad Air or even the regular iPad is a better buy for people who don’t really need the awesome display or the added processing power you get with a Pro. It’s a top-of-the-line machine and it’s priced accordingly. I think there are a few ways Apple could make this iPad even better. You can add an external display, for example, but you can’t really use it the way you’d use an external screen with a Mac — for instance, by dragging and dropping apps to it. You can just mirror the iPad screen or use some added tools and features for workflows in apps that support the additional display. This seems to be a limitation of iPadOS since we know the M1 Macs support external monitors with plenty of apps just fine.  And speaking of macOS, as I said in my recent iMac review, I wish there was some sort of convergence between the two. There are times, like with an external monitor attached, that I wish I could just use macOS and have various windows open all over the place for much faster multitasking with the trackpad and keyboard. Lastly, this is just a personal preference, but I generally like the smaller 11-inch size most of the time. It’s just easier to hold when you’re lounging in bed compared with the 12.9-inch. On the other hand, with a keyboard attached, I like the 12.9-inch better. So, my advice is to try both sizes if you’re not necessarily buying the 12.9-inch model for the brighter screen.

Samsung also showed off some features for productivity and multitasking, including one that lets users sync up notes and share files between different devices. The company hopes its new tablet range can tempt Apple users away from its popular iPad computers.

Here’s HSBC forecast Each of Samsung’s new smartphones and tablets come with chips made using the so-called 4-nanometer process, which is expected to improve performance and power efficiency. The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra will retail at $1,100, while the S8 and S8+ are priced at $700 and $900, respectively. All of Samsung’s new devices are now available for preorder, with the Galaxy S22 Ultra and Tab S8 series slated for release on Feb. 25. The S22 and S22+ will ship from Mar. 11, Samsung said. The unveiling of Samsung’s latest devices arrives several months after Apple launched the iPhone 13. Like Apple, Samsung is offering mainly incremental updates with the S22 range, including an improved camera and brighter screen. With its new phones, Samsung isn’t trying to wow people with flashy features like folding screens. Instead, it’s hoping to tempt those who have shied away from upgrading their phones in recent years, content with the features on offer with existing handsets. The South Korean electronics giant is set to attend the Mobile World Congress industry event in Barcelona later this month, so there’s a chance it could have more tech to unveil soon. A key improvement the S22 Ultra makes to its predecessor is the camera module. Whereas the Galaxy S21 Ultra had a sizable bump on the back of the phone to house the camera, its successor does away with this, embedding it directly into the device. Samsung’s S22 Ultra is very much aimed at more techie types and professional photographers who like to play around with all the best features a smartphone has to offer.

1470," better camera and apps and faster processor with no form factor change, what is Apple going to do?” said Ian Campbell, CEO of Nucleus Research, an IT research firm. “I think it’s a tough moment for Apple and it’s going to be very carefully scripted.” Apple is likely to release three new models, according to reports. The two higher-end iPhones will have a 5.8-inch and a 6.1-inch OLED display, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee. These phones can be seen as sequels to the current iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, which cost a minimum of $999 and $1099 respectively. Apple is also expected to release a lower-priced iPhone with a lower-cost LCD screen, like the current iPhone XR, which currently costs $749 or more. One big selling point for the new iPhones will be camera features, Kuo predicted earlier this year. The higher-end phones could get a third camera, which Apple could use to perform advanced image processing by combining the image, improving low-light photos and correct errors, according to Bloomberg. Apple’s lower-end iPhone, the XR successor, may get additional colors and finishes, as well as a second back-facing camera sensor, according to the report. The phones will also be able to charge other devices, like AirPods, if they’re compatible and they are placed on the back of one of Apple’s new phones, according to Kuo. Samsung’s high-end 2019 phones have a similar feature. Don’t expect these iPhones to support 5G — that’s a planned 2020 feature, according to TF Securities and J.P. Morgan. Since 2014, Apple has also used its fall event to launch new Apple Watch models. The EEC database was updated in August with four new Apple Watch models listed. Last year, Apple released the Series 4, which sported a new hardware design and bigger screens. This year’s models are expected to have the same design, according to Bloomberg, although Apple may release new case materials, including ceramic and titanium, which would likely be high-end models. There may also be new features for Apple Watches, especially in software. For example, internal versions of Apple’s software have included a feature called “Schooltime,” according",error,513
1470," to MacRumors. Schooltime will block access to apps or other distracting features during a school day, but will enable the student to call their parents or emergency numbers, according to the report. There’s also a new sleep tracking app planned for the Apple Watch, according to 9to5Mac. It’s code-named “Burrito” and called “Time in Bed tracking.” It requires a user to wear a charged Apple Watch to go to bed and will allow users to have two Apple Watches, one specifically for bedtime, according to the report. The feature doesn’t need any additional hardware. Instead, it will use the watch’s existing sensors and inputs to measure the quality of a person’s sleep. It will also automatically turn off alarms if the user wakes up before their alarm is supposed to wake up. (Apple bought a sleep tracking hardware start-up, Beddit, in 2017, but it’s unclear how that technology relates to the reported Apple Watch feature.) Last year, Apple held two fall events: one for iPhones and Apple Watches, and a month later for new iPads and MacBook laptops. It’s unclear whether Apple will do that this year or cram it all into one show. The Eurasian database registered five unreleased iPad models in July and several unreleased Mac laptops in June. According to MacRumors, one of the models could be a MacBook Pro with a 16-inch screen. That computer would be targeted at professional computer users, who need extra power, according to Bloomberg, which previously reported on the device. Apple’s wireless earbuds, AirPods, could get an update. They were refreshed earlier this year with a new case that enables it to charge wirelessly on Qi charging pads. Apple could also release a piece of hardware that attaches to objects and allows users to track them through an iPhone app, like current products from companies such as Tile. Internal screenshots published by MacRumors show it attached to keys, luggage and a bicycle. Apple laid the groundwork for this product in June, when it announced a new technology that would enable Apple to track Mac laptops. Apple also could choose to launch its streaming video service, Apple TV+ and its game subscription, Apple Arcade. The services were announced earlier this year, but Apple hasn’t revealed a price or launch date yet. Independent Apple analyst Neil Cybart wrote in a newsletter on Thursday that it would make sense for Apple to discuss",error,513
1472," with employees of suppliers to ensure they received training and were aware of proper channels to voice concerns. “However, our recent findings on working conditions at Zhengzhou Foxconn highlights several issues which are in violation of Apple’s own code of conduct,” CLW wrote in its report. “Apple has the responsibility and capacity to make fundamental improvements to the working conditions along its supply chain, however, Apple is now transferring costs from the trade war through their suppliers to workers and profiting from the exploitation of Chinese workers.” For its part, Apple said: “When we find issues, we work with our suppliers to take immediate corrective action.” Here is Apple’s statement: “We believe everyone in our supply chain should be treated with dignity and respect. To make sure our high standards are being adhered to, we have robust management systems in place beginning with training on workplace rights, on-site worker interviews, anonymous grievance channels and ongoing audits. When we find issues, we work with our suppliers to take immediate corrective action.We looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false. We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor.We did find during our investigation that the percentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standards and we are working closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.” This is Foxconn’s statement to CNBC: “Foxconn employs a workforce in its operations in China that is comprised of a combination of full-time employees and dispatch workers. In addition, in some locations, we have an established, short-term internship program that we carry out in cooperation with local governments and vocational schools. In all cases and with all types of workers, we offer an industry-competitive salary and related benefits that significantly exceeds government-mandated levels. We work hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations across all our operations. We can confirm that a recent review of our operations at our facility in Zhengzhou did identify some workforce compliance issues. As soon as we received the results of that review, we immediately began a detailed process to ensure that all issues were addressed.

The device features a 6.1-inch display, an hour longer battery life compared to the iPhone XR, faster Face ID and an A13 Bionic chip, making it the “fastest CPU and GPU ever in a smartphone,” the company said. The iPhone 11 comes in six new colors, including purple, green, yellow, white, red and black. It features a dual-camera system on the rear panel, including an all-new wide-angle lens with 2x optical zoom out. The cameras are packed with upgraded sensors, allowing for features like multiscale tone mapping for improved highlights, as well as night mode, which helps brighten photos in dark environments. Additionally, the iPhone 11 features a 12-megapixel TrueDepth camera on the front, which lets users film slow motion videos, along with wide angle selfies. As part of the iPhone launch, Apple also rolled out a new trade-in program for several countries. The new iPhones start at $399, $599 and $699 with trade ins, or at lower prices on a monthly basis. Apple’s streaming video subscription service will roll out on Nov. 1 and starts at $4.99 per month for a family account. It’ll be available in 100 countries at launch, with new shows being added each month. The company said users can get a one year subscription for free with a purchase of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV. Apple debuted a trailer for “See,” its new sci-fi drama starring Jason Momoa, that’s set to launch on Apple TV+ along with other original titles. Other original series that are expected to launch on the service include “The Morning Show,” which stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell, in addition to “Dickinson,” a drama series about Emily Dickenson that stars Hailee Steinfeld. Apple Arcade, its gaming subscription service, will launch on Sept. 19 in 150 countries around the world, with 100 new games, starting at $4.99 for families. As part of the launch, the company is rolling out a new Arcade tab in the App Store to house games for the subscription gaming service",error,513

The Apple Watch Series 5 starts at $399 for a GPS version, then bumps up to $499 with 4G network connectivity. It’s available for order today and lands in stores on Sept. 20. Apple is still selling the older Series 3 watch, plus cutting the price to $199. The new device includes a new always-on display, which allows users to be able to see the time and notifications when they haven’t raised their wrist. Even with the always on display, Apple says the new Watch still has 18-hours worth of battery life, thanks to a new low-temperature polysilicone and oxide display, as well as a low-power display driver. Apple is launching the new Watch models with three different casing materials, including aluminum, ceramic and stainless steel, as well as titanium, which is a first for the company. It also includes new features like a compass and international emergency calling. The company has continued its focus on health and fitness in the latest Apple Watch. The device now has menstrual cycle tracking, as part of the watchOS 6 software, as well as a new research app, which is set to launch in the US later this year. Users can enroll in three studies to start, such as hearing, women’s health and heart and movement. The company took the wraps off of a new 10.2-inch iPad, replacing the 9.7-inch model. The seventh-generation device features a Retina display, an 8-megapixel camera and it has Apple’s A10 Fusion chip built in, which the company said is 2x faster than the top-selling PC. The device is compatible with Apple’s smart keyboard, as well as the first-generation Apple Pencil. The new iPad is available for order today and will start shipping on Sept. 30. The device starts at $329 and education customers can buy the new iPad for $299. Apple is reopening its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York on Sept. 20, the same date that its new iPhones will launch. Earlier this month, the company teased the store’s reopening by unveiling a new colorful glass coating. The entrance to the store was closed as of January 2017, while the store was moved to a temporary location. The rainbow colors are temporary and the cube will eventually return to",error,513

(This year’s iPhones have the same screens as last year’s.) Since the design of this year’s phones matches last year’s, highlighting the change in its physical camera design is one of the few ways to distinguish an iPhone 11 from an iPhone X on billboards and other advertisements. “In a weird way, the number of cameras on the back of your iPhone will become a social signal,” Cybart predicted last week. Apple also needs to keep up with rivals like Samsung or Huawei, which are also releasing phones with multiple cameras and using machine learning techniques to combine photos for better results, analysts said. One example is night mode, a new feature that uses machine learning to brighten photographs taken in low light. A very similar feature called Night Sight was a key part of Google’s Pixel phones last year, and was featured in advertisements run in the United States. Analysts also highlighted how Apple is using artificial intelligence and machine learning to create photographs that are actually multiple photographs combined to make a better shot than is possible with a single camera. Apple calls its feature “Deep Fusion,” and while it’s not shipping with the new iPhones, it will be added in a future software update. “It shoots nine images. Before you press the shutter button, it’s already shot four short images, four secondary images,” Schiller said. “When you press the shutter button it takes one long exposure, and then in just one second the neural engine analyzes the fewest combination of long and short images, picking the best among them, selecting all the pixels, and pixel by pixel, going through 24 million pixels to optimize for detail and low noise.” Apple’s ”‘secret sauce’ is more in the software and how Apple is leveraging AI for photography,” Zimmerman said. “They presented the Deep Fusion feature that helps with the small details in a shot all driven by the AI capability of the A13 Bionic.” “It takes a lot of resources and only a few can do this, so Apple is among the top 5 but were they the first to market with a triple-camera system leveraging AI and high-",error,513
1487," Leahy. Apple had recently taken several virtual private networking (VPN) apps off of its App Store platform in China. VPN apps enable users to route all their web traffic through a remote server, and VPNs are often used to access content that’s blocked by China’s so-called “great firewall.” “We are concerned that Apple may be enabling the Chinese government’s censorship and surveillance of the internet,” the senators wrote. Apple responded in a letter signed by Cynthia Hogan, Apple’s vice president for public policy. It summarizes Apple’s approach to the China issue — that Apple believes that by doing business in the country, it promotes “the free flow of ideas and information,” and at the same time, Apple has to follow the laws of every country it operates in. “We believe that Apple can best promote fundamental rights, including the right of free expression, by being engaged even where we may disagree with a particular country’s law,” Hogan wrote. A recent security dustup between Apple and Google also highlighted how carefully tech companies need to handle how Beijing will interpret given events. An elite Google security team recently published findings that suggested that simply visiting a given website on your iPhone could unleash a chain of hacks, giving the attacker access to text messages, photos, and contacts. Google didn’t mention that the iPhone hacks were part of a larger program that also targeted Windows and Android computers and phones, and it didn’t mention who had built these websites and designed the malware. (A Google spokesperson at the time declined to identify the attackers and didn’t offer a reason why Google didn’t identify the group.) Apple responded to Google, but it also didn’t mention the attackers. Apple did however, mention who the hackers were targeting: Uighurs, a muslim minority in China. An estimated 1.5 million Uighurs have been forced to attend detention and “re-education” camps by the Chinese government in the region of Xinjiang, many of them for violating what Amnesty International describes as a “highly restrictive and discriminatory” law that China says is designed to combat extremism. The only group with the resources and motivation to target Uiguirs with extremely valuable hacks would be the Chinese government. But Apple’s response to Google doesn’t include the word “China” and it avoids connecting the dots about which group actually was able to hack",error,513
1488," Apples are grown in the arid valleys and brown hillsides of central Washington, a few hours east of Seattle, and watered by irrigation projects. The state has around 1,500 apple growers and 175,000 acres of orchards. About 50,000 people pick some 12 billion apples by hand each fall. The fruit is exported to 60 countries. With so much success, why was a new apple variety needed? “A new apple brings excitement,” said Toni Lynn Adams, spokeswoman for the Washington Apple Commission, which markets apples internationally. “A new variety can reinvigorate a market and industry.” Washington growers, who had watched the market share for sometimes mushy Red Delicious apples plummet over time, were looking to replicate the success of the Honeycrisp, Adams said. “It’s going to shake things up in a great way,” Adams said. “We’re expecting it to increase in volume rapidly.” Adams could not speculate on how much Cosmic Crisp apples will cost per pound. “Better quality makes for better returns,” said Clark, the grower. “This is a for-profit deal, man. We’re trying to make some money with it.” Remarkably, this is the first apple variety developed in Washington state, which has been known for apples for more than a century. Scientists at WSU’s Tree Fruit Research Center in Wenatchee spent 20 years breeding the desired apple tree seeds. In addition to helping pay for that research, apple growers need a license to buy the trees and pay a royalty on sales of the fruit. The trees take three years to produce a crop, said Kathryn Grandy, a member of the team marketing the apple. “This will be the largest launch of a single variety ever, globally,” she said, and it’s backed by a $10.5 million marketing budget. Consumers will not have trouble finding the variety, said Grandy, who works for a company called Proprietary Variety Management and is based in the town of Chelan, in the heart of apple country. Work on developing the variety began in 1997, said Evans, of Washington State University. The process of cross-hybridization has been used to breed plants for hundreds of years, Evans said, and is quite different from the more controversial genetic modification methods. “The goal, in my opinion, is to get more consumers eating",error,513
1493," subscriptions to TV shows and video games, and wearable computers like the Apple Watch, the iPhone remains one of the key ways for investors and analysts to evaluate the health of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. In the year ending on June 30, 54% of Apple’s $249 billion in revenue was directly attributable to iPhone sales. “We underscore that (like last year) near-term investor sentiment is likely to be shaped by iPhone revenues,” Sacconaghi wrote. The iPhone is required for many of Apple’s growth businesses: people with iPhones are more likely to sign up for iCloud, or Apple TV+, and you need an iPhone or else the Apple Watch won’t work. Apple’s iPhone strategy hasn’t changed since last year: It released three phones, two higher-end models that start at $999 or more, called the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, and a lower-priced phone that’s meant to be the mainstream model, called the iPhone 11. This year, Apple reduced the starting price of the iPhone 11 by $50, which some analysts say is boosting demand. “Monthly iPhone trends in China are encouraging with data showing growth in two of the last 3Qs and comps also get much easier toward year-end,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote, suggesting that showing growth could be easier for Apple given last year’s guidance miss, and predicting that iPhone unit sales would grow 1% year-over-year to 188 million units. “Investor sentiment on iPhone units has reversed in the recent weeks following the successful launch of iPhone 11 models with a general bias to the upside in 2020,” Arcuri continued. Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty wrote that some data points were leading her team of analysts to believe that “iPhone replacement cycles are in the process of stabilizing in some markets following the introduction of the iPhone 11 models.” “Our analysis of store foot traffic data in the U.S. and web traffic globally indicates that customer interest for iPhone 11 is tracking better than the XS last year,” Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy wrote. Ultimately, many analysts remain bullish on Apple because of the chance it could spur a big upgrade cycle with a 5G iPhone in 2020. Apple is unlikely to confirm that timeline or discuss any future products during Wednesday’s earnings. Apple’s “services” business",error,513
1493," will also be closely watched. The line item contains everything from extended warranties to iCloud and Apple Arcade subscriptions. Eventually, analysts say, Apple TV+ will show up in Apple’s earnings report, given that the iPhone maker is spending billions on new shows, and those costs have to be accounted for somewhere. Apple could choose to discuss its accounting treatment for its TV shows and movies going forward on Wednesday given that it’s the start of a new fiscal year and a topic of intense speculation among Wall Street analysts. “We note that estimating TV+ cost impacts to Apple comes along with a lot of uncertainty. Apple can control cost amortization through show release schedules and multiple assumptions about the eventual viewership of each show,” Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall wrote. “The accounting treatment of free TV+ subscription with the purchase of most hardware adds some complexity and uncertainty to the near-term model,” Arcuri wrote. Apple said last month that it does “not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.” Another key service investors are watching is is Apple’s App Store, in which Apple collects between 15% and 30% of sales of iPhone and iPad apps and content. Apple doesn’t break down its services line item, but growth in App Store revenue would encourage several analysts. “Looking forward, App Store comps continue to ease into the December quarter (most notably in China), and we expect contributions from new Services such as Apple TV+ to begin impacting the model as early as the December 2019 quarter as well, resulting in our forecast for 17.7% Y/Y growth next quarter,” Huberty wrote. “Beyond early performance of the new iPhone cycle, Services is another key swing factor for [September quarter] results as Apple looks to increasingly monetize its installed base of [more than] 900 million iPhones,” Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral wrote. The newest Apple Watch will also have about 10 days of sales included in Wednesday’s earnings, and a full quarter of sales will be accounted for in Apple’s projections. Many analysts see Apple’s AirPods, Watch and Beats Headphones comprising a fast-growing “wearables” business. Apple leadership has also highlighted those product lines as a growth engine for the company. Apple CEO Tim Cook sometimes provides a data point on those three lines together during earnings. “W",error,513
1516," on the App Store on Wednesday in the United States revealed mostly benign results. The top result was a Portuguese-language app about the outbreak published by the Brazilian government. Below that was an unrelated wallpaper app, a game that looks similar to top-grossing epidemic game Plague Inc, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s app, the Epoch Times, and an app with COVID-19 information published by Unbound, a developer of medical apps.  The top result for “COVID 19” is a “virus tracker” from a developer called Healthlynked with WHO figures and maps charting where confirmed cases have been. It’s currently No. 2. for medical apps on Apple’s app store in the United States. Below that is the Unbound app and several Chinese-language apps.  App Review, the department inside Apple that manually screens every single iPhone app before they become available to download on Apple’s platforms, relies on a document called the App Store Review Guidelines to justify their decisions to software companies about what’s allowed on iPhones. Developers who had coronavirus apps rejected by Apple said that reviewers cited a guideline numbered 5.2.1, which says that “apps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual property and other relevant rights.” Tweet Zachary Shakked, who makes apps to help small businesses manage social media accounts, said although he was sympathetic to Apple’s need to prevent misinformation, he had published apps in the past with high ratings and hundreds of thousands of downloads, and suggested a tiered system to separate spammers or misinformation from vetted developers. An updated policy published by Apple on Wednesday has a new item, 5.1.1.ix, which is close to what developers said they were told. Apps in “highly-regulated” fields like healthcare, financial services, or air travel need to be submitted by a “legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer.” Apple’s App Store policies have drawn criticism for being inscrutable, and some competitors have claimed Apple has too much power given that the App Store is the only way to distribute software for iPhones to the public. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in 2019 that App Store rules “purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience” and filed a complaint with the EU. At a congressional hearing in",error,513
1517," month of February with stores closed and the supply chain under massive pressure due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country,” Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Monday. On top of that, there are concerns that Apple may not be able to launch new products on time, and that may include a rumored 5G-capable iPhone. Since the record intra-day high, Apple shares have fallen nearly 19% that’s wiped off billions of dollars in value, even as the broader equity markets saw a violent sell-off.  According to a Reuters poll, analysts are still predicting that Apple could potentially hit new record highs this year after a big rally in 2019. In fact, the current average 12-month price target on Apple’s stock is $333.57. If realized, it would represent a 25% rise from Monday’s closing price. It would also be a new record high for the stock.  Given that the $333.57 figure is a 12-month price target, analysts say it could even be reached in 2021. Getting there will be a lot harder than it seemed earlier in the year, however, particularly as the coronavirus spread has gone global. UBS warned in a note last week that demand impact is “likely to expand beyond China.”  “We had moved some demand from March into June but given the broader impact, we now think the demand impact could continue into Jun,” analysts at the investment bank said. UBS lowered its June quarter iPhone unit sales by an estimated 2 million, to 38 million units. It also reduced its earnings and revenue estimates for Apple for the fiscal year ending September 2020.  But analysts still feel that the coronavirus is a near-term issue for Apple and that its long-term growth story remains intact. Ives said the weak demand from China in the March quarter is a “shock event” that will be “short lived” with “normalized iPhone demand trends” to resume in the second half of the year around the world. The Wedbush analyst said the iPhone’s huge install base, pent-up upgrade demand, growing services business such as Apple music, and a potential new 5G iPhone, will be catalysts for the company.  “With markets seeing an avalanche of selling pressuring triggering circuit breakers, we encourage investors to take a deep breath and focus on the tech winners for the next 5",error,513
1523," Apple TV+, lots of tabs in Chrome, Slack and photos at once. Apple used to include a Core i5 chip in the $999 model but told me that this Core i3 chip is a big upgrade from the 2018 Core i5, so most people should still see a performance bump. But if you want a computer that will run modern apps for several years, you should consider at least getting the Core i5 model, just for a bit of future-proofing and extra power. And speaking of power, while I wasn’t able to test this without owning a 6K display, the 2020 MacBook Air is the first to support up to 6K displays, a nod to the new Intel Iris graphics that are included in all models. The speakers are great, although not quite as good as the stellar speakers on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which I reviewed last year. But you’ll like them — they’re full, sound balanced, and don’t get too tinny like most laptop speakers. The 13-inch Retina Display is sharp and colorful and has the True Tone technology that Apple offers in iPhones and some iPads. This wasn’t in my 2018 MacBook Air but was added to the MacBook Air refresh in 2019. It’s a nice upgrade and feels more comfortable to look at, since the whites balance depending on your environment ever so subtly. It’s a feature I love, and it’s a good bump if you’re coming from a 2018 MacBook Air, as I am. I’ve only had the new MacBook Air for about a day, so I’m still fiddling with battery life to see how long it’ll run. That takes longer than a day. But, it seems to be good enough to get through most of a workday so long as I keep the brightness at about half max. Stay tuned for more on battery life in a couple of days as I use it longer. I’m pleased to report that the new keyboard is a vast improvement. I’ve been using a 2018 MacBook Air for two years and, over time, it started to get jammed due to the older butterfly-design. That keyboard design is much more shallow and helped Apple create super-thin laptops, but it ended up being frustrating to type on because key presses didn’t always register. The scissors-switch design in the new MacBook Air has a proven track record in other machines. It worked well",error,513
1523," in the 16-inch MacBook Pro and is based on the design of the popular wireless Magic Keyboard that Apple sells as an accessory. Just for quick comparison, here’s the 2018 MacBook Air. Notice how the keyboard looks really similar: But the new one is much more pleasant to type on. The keys feel like they have more give to them when you press down, and I was immediately typing with fewer typos. So far, they haven’t jammed on me. Then again, the problem didn’t appear for about a year after I bought my last MacBook Air, so it’ll take longer before I know for sure how reliable it is. The complaints I have about the 2020 MacBook Air are relatively minor. The first is the same complaint I had with the 2018 MacBook Air: The webcam is still only 720p. It’s fine, but not great. I wish Apple would upgrade it to at least 1080p for sharper video chats. It seems like the space is there. Also, I sort of wish Apple included Face ID in its computers. Microsoft supports “Windows Hello” on some Windows 10 computers, which includes the option to unlock some laptops just by looking at them, just like Face ID on an iPhone or iPad. The MacBook Air doesn’t include that option, although the fingerprint reader works just fine. Plus, it’s easy to configure it to unlock if you’re nearby wearing an Apple Watch, which is nice. Buying a Mac gets you access to Apple’s entire ecosystem, like Messages, Apple News and Apple TV+. But some people just prefer Windows to macOS. If you’re not a Mac person, or have no real preference between the two systems, there are some really nice Windows 10 laptops out there you should know about. The 13-inch HP Spectre 360 2-in-1, for example, costs $1,299.99 and comes with a 512 GB drive and a Core i7 processor. It’s often on sale for $999 or less, but that same configuration for a MacBook Air would cost you $1,449.00. Dell sells the XPS 13 2-in-1, another laptop lots of reviewers like, with a Core i7 chip and 256 GB of storage for $1,399.99. Those two laptops also work as so-called “2-in-1” computers that let you rotate the screen 360-degrees and prop it",error,513
1526,"100 for the iPhone 11. The $599 iPhone XR is the last available version of the iPhone X family (that’s a roman numeral 10, not the letter X), which was launched in 2018. Apple still sells it as an attractive lower-cost phone that offers some of the stuff you’ll find in higher-end iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models. That includes Face ID, if unlocking the phone using your face is important to you, and a larger screen that’s nicer for watching movies. It starts at $599 with 64GB of storage and is also available with 128GB of storage for $649. On the inside, it’s got an A12 processor that’s slightly older and less powerful than the one in the $399 iPhone SE, or in Apple’s iPhone 11 lineup. You probably won’t notice the performance hit, but know that you’re not getting the most advanced technology with the XR. I still believe the 6.1-inch iPhone 11 is the best iPhone for most people, as I said when I reviewed it last September. It might be tough to justify spending a lot of money for a new phone given the uncertainty in the economy right now, which is why folks should buy the iPhone SE if they’re on a budget, but the iPhone 11 is still a better phone. It starts at $699 for 64GB of storage, but a 128GB model will set you back $749 and the 256GB option costs $849. For that price, you get great battery life, a second ultra-wide camera lens that’s a lot of fun to use for capturing more of a scene, stereo speakers, Face ID and Apple’s latest A13 Bionic processor. It just doesn’t have as fancy a display, or some of the other aesthetic refinements such as steel accents, as you’ll find in Apple’s more expensive iPhones. At a time when people are concerned about losing their jobs, you should either buy this or the new iPhone SE. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are for people who want everything Apple can stuff into a smartphone. They’re the best of the bunch, with prices that reflect that. They have pretty much identical features save for price and screen size. Both iPhone 11 Pro models give you the brightest and most colorful screen Apple offers. The phones have an extra camera sensor for 2x optical zoom",error,513
1531," those people and suggest they get tested or socially isolate themselves. Personal technology like cellphones can be used to facilitate digital contact tracing. A phone has various technologies that can be used to pinpoint where a user has been, and which other phones have come nearby, without requiring them to remember exactly where they were and who was nearby. As the coronavirus pandemic took off, authorities turned to digital contact tracing as a possible way to help track and slow the spread of the disease without having to hire a large number of human tracers. Some early contact tracing apps like Trace Together in Singapore used a phone’s Bluetooth signal, which has a range of about 30 feet, to figure out when two phones were near each other. Strong signals suggest that two people are very close, while weak ones suggest that they’re too far apart for there to be potential exposure (although experts like Ashkan Soltani, the former CTO for the Federal Trade Commission have warned it’s by no means a perfect system). If a person was identified with coronavirus, they could let Singapore’s Ministry of Health look at the app data and notify other people who had been near them recently. But there was a big usability problem. On an iPhone, the app had to be running all the time in the foreground, or it stopped working. That meant that phones needed to remain unlocked -- a nightmare scenario if they got stolen -- and burned through battery life quickly. Apple App Store reviews for Trace Together included complaints from users that the app was preventing them from receiving notifications while they were out and about. The alternative was to use GPS, which countries like China and South Korea had already leveraged to track exposure. But apps that tracked location draw immediate concern from privacy advocates. One human rights group went as far as to refer to the location-tracking apps in China as “automated tyranny.” On March 21, a Swiss engineering professor Edouard Bugnion reached out to Apple’s developer relations team to voice some of these concerns. Bugnion, the founding CTO of VMWare, recognized then that digital contact tracing apps would need Apple’s help to work well and preserve user privacy.  He wasn’t the only one. Within a day or two, these issues came to the attention of Apple’s Myoung Cha, who’s responsible for the business side of the company’s growing health team. Cha, a",error,513
1531," senior strategist for the company’s health care division, reports to the company’s COO, Jeff Williams.  Cha and a small team at Apple were already exploring methods of using smartphones for contact tracing. The early team included Ron Huang, who runs Apple’s location services group, and Dr. Guy “Bud” Tribble, a veteran Apple software vice president who is referred to internally as the “privacy czar.” Tribble, who is also a medical doctor, is known outside of Apple for speaking out in favor of federal privacy legislation, noting at a Senate hearing that in 2018 that privacy should be a human right.  Huang agreed to loop in a group of engineers who were willing to volunteer their time to the project. They included some of the company’s in-house cryptography experts, Yannick Sierra and Frederic Jacobs (Jacobs has been credited for helping create the secure messaging app Signal). The team began researching some of the protocols for electronic contact tracing already underway at the Massachusetts Institute of Techology and EPFL, a similarly well-regarded research university in Switzerland. Their idea would be to use Bluetooth to track phones’ proximity without detailed location data, like the Singapore app -- but in a way that wouldn’t require apps to be running all the time. The Apple employees also favored decentralized approaches. The idea was that a phone belonging to a user who had tested positive would send anonymous alerts directly to other phones that it had been nearby, instead of uploading all this information to a government or other central authority. This would prevent governments from building a database with detailed location or proximity information. The Apple team also believed any system would need to be “opt-in,” where the individual gives consent to share information with other phones. Cha shared this thinking on a call with Bugnion on April 6. “It was very clear to me from day one that Apple wanted to ensure the highest level of privacy,” Bugnion recalled. The team knew they needed to execute quickly. By then, public health officials in many countries were taking contact tracing seriously as a way to help end lockdowns quickly and safely. A group of researchers from Oxford University had already seen promising results from a theoretical model: “Our models show we can stop the epidemic if approximately 60% of the population use the app, and even with lower numbers of app users, we still estimate a reduction in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths",error,513
1531,",” noted Christophe Fraser, senior author of the latest report from Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Medicine. Employees at Google were thinking through similar ideas. The key employees taking the lead on the Google side included Yul Kwon, a senior director for the company and a former deputy chief privacy officer at Facebook (incidentally, Kwon is well known outside of Google as the winner of the 2006 show “Survivor: Cook Islands.”) Senior product manager Ronald Ho, who works on Bluetooth and connectivity efforts, was also heavily involved from the outset. Google had its own codename for the project, separate from Apple’s: “Apollo.” Eventually, the team presented their ideas to Google’s vice president of Android, Dave Burke, who talked it through Apple’s Cha. It wasn’t a foregone conclusion that the two companies, which have a long history of bitter competition in smartphones, would cooperate. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was convinced that Android had been built to mimic Apple’s iOS, and the two companies had a bitter legal fight before settling their differences in 2014. Although they coexist more peacefully now, they’re still tough rivals, with the two dominant smartphone platforms in the world. But in this case, they knew they had to come together. A system for exposure notification needed to be interoperable, otherwise there would be huge gaps in coverage. The two companies couldn’t formally announce plans to work together until they got a green-light from their CEOs. So Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai hashed it out on a virtual meeting several days ahead of the official announcement on April 10th. “Contact tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy,” Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted triumphantly to announce the initiative.  The joint solution is not an app. Rather, the companies have published an application programming interface -- API -- which is a set of specifications that public health organizations can tap into to build their own contact tracing apps. Here’s how it works. Once Bluetooth is turned on and the user opts in, the phone sends anonymous little chirps that other phones can listen into. Critically, Apple’s API means the app can continue to send these chirps out even if it’s not running in the foreground at the time.    To ensure",error,513
1531," user privacy, the companies have lifted ideas from various open-source efforts like MIT’s PACT and Europe’s DP-3T. Google’s Burke has acknowledged that his team was specifically inspired by the work of DP-3T, nothing that he thought it “gives the best privacy preserving aspects of the contacts tracing service.” One specific example inspired by DP-3T is the idea of using rotating codes, which involves the apps broadcasting a cryptographic key that changes randomly, while they monitor other nearby phones. Once the user reports a Covid-19 diagnosis, the app will upload the cryptographic keys that were used to generate the codes from the past few weeks onto a server. Everyone else’s app downloads those keys, and looks for a match with one of the stored codes. If it finds one, the app will notify the users that they might have been exposed. This allows the app to notify people who may have been exposed, without having to know their identities -- or allowing those identities to be stored and tracked by any central authority. “We are developing an app and system that could be deployed in Europe, and the world,” said Carmela Troncoso, a privacy researcher at EPFL and one of the key developers behind DP-3T. “That’s a lot of people. And we owe it to them to be transparent.” The companies are increasingly making clear to the outside world that their API isn’t a form of automated contact tracing that should be relied upon completely. Instead, it’s intended to support humans working at public health departments. Some countries are already on board with that, including Germany, Estonia, Singapore, and Switzerland. Others, like the U.K. and France, are still considering a more centralized approach. In the U.S., states are still largely taking their own approaches. Going forward, there are still some major question marks about the potential for fraud and abuse. And the companies will need to address how they plan to vet the apps built on top of these APIs to ensure that these developers will not exploit any privacy vulnerabilities.  But Marcel Salathé, a prominent Swiss researcher and epidemiologist, noted on Twitter last week that he is surprised to see two tech companies take privacy so seriously, while some governments advocate for more intrusive approaches. “I’ve made a few correct predictions about Covid,” he tweeted. “But I would not in",error,513
1538," data if it means ending the pandemic, but Oxford researchers say it could require more than half the total population to agree to contact tracing to be effective. The Apple and Google effort has won some guarded support from privacy groups, and countries with strict privacy laws, such as Germany, which was originally reluctant to endorse the approach. The tech giants also responded to criticisms from privacy advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union. “Technologically, there’s a lot of value that can be created here... and there are actually lots of ways to still safeguard privacy even with tools like this,” Ohanian said. “The bigger issue is the lack of trust and the fact that you’re going to need to get users over the mental hurdle of being willing to have this information stored on Google or someone else’s servers.” Apple has had one of the stronger records in the tech industry of focusing on privacy, even taking its defense of individual privacy into battles at the highest levels of the U.S. government, in cases where the Justice Department and FBI have wanted access to user phones. Past survey work has revealed public wariness about health information specifically. Only 11% of people said they were comfortable sharing their health data with tech companies, according to a 2018 survey, though Alphabet’s Google fared well relative to other companies in that survey. “When it comes to health, there is a higher standard than typical social media, sharing everything about yourself,” Ohanian said. Companies including Apple and Google have been moving more into the health-care sector — and becoming involved in debates over patient data — where they see big opportunities for growing use of technology. Other countries are considering a different approach to contain the virus. The U.K.’s National Health Service, whose app will be available within weeks, said it supports a “centralized” framework rather than a “decentralized” one used by companies like Google and Apple. A decentralized system like the one used by Apple and Google would be anonymous and would not require a phone number or email address to use. A centralized approach like that of the NHS sends data to public health authorities so they can directly contact people who may have been infected. Although there are ways to prevent your data from being collected by tech companies, Google spokesman Johnny Luu said in a statement to the Washington Post that the company’s contact-tracing system “would not involve sharing data about",error,513

Apple’s third quarter revenues grew by 11%.  The stock has also outrun Wall Street’s analysts’ forecasts, surpassing the average target of $427.87 by $40 so far. “It’s always been a fan favorite among traders, besides institutions and long-term investors,” said Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3Live.com. “It was a safe haven during the pandemic, and it’s also been an area for growth.” He said investors now see benefits in not only the stock split, but its dividend and the fact it stock looks set to continue to appreciate.  “It’s an asset class of its own. It’s almost as if Apple is its own market. Apple’s been pretty much leading the market since the lows in March,” said Redler. “The next thing will be how does it react after it splits.” Apple’s stock split is the company’s fifth. It previously split on a 7-1 basis in 2014, and a 2-1 basis in 2005, 2000, and 1987. Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said Apple’s chart has looked particularly strong since its earnings and stock split announcement. “It’s always been a go-to name and it’s always rewarded. When Apple is above the 21-day [moving average], the trend is strong, and it’s basically been above the 21-day since the March lows,” said Redler. But like many tech names, Apple is facing new issues, including questions about its supply chain as tensions grow between the U.S. and China. It also has a strong market presence in China for its products. “I think Apple is unusually vulnerable,” said Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners. “I have been a huge fan of the stock for decades. I have recently sold a signification portion of my position because it feels to me that external factors, things beyond [CEO] Tim Cook’s control will now determine the next 12 to 18 months for its stock.” He said China is a risk for Apple, and there are other issues that could impact it, including disputes over the App store.",error,513
1562," that shows the weather forecast and temperature for where you are. Siri will also support audio messages, so you can tell the voice assistant you want to begin recording and then send that recording off to someone. Dictation will be rendered on the device, instead of sent to the cloud. Apple Translate. IOS 14 includes a new Apple Translate app that enables real-time translation between two languages. It’s similar to Google Translate, allowing you to either speak or type in text for a translation. Users will be able to switch between the language they want to translate from and the language they want to translate to at the top of the screen. Turning the phone into landscape (sideways) puts it into conversation mode so two people can chat side by side. Apple said it will support entire conversations, not just small phrases, and it’ll work completely offline. It will support 11 languages when it launches.  Digital car key. IOS 14 and the current version, iOS 13, will soon enable digital car keys that let you unlock and start your car from your iPhone. There’s a catch: It’ll only work with one car to start, the 2021 BMW 5 Series. But Apple says it is working on standards with industry groups to bring the feature to more cars, and it expects to see a new standard using Apple’s ultra-wideband chip next year. You’ll also be able to share car keys through Apple Messages or remove access through iCloud. Privacy features. There are lots of improvements that keep what you do on your iPhone private. The biggest is called “App Privacy,” and it will show you what kind of personal information an app will ask for before you use it. So, you’ll know if an app is going to ask for your location, contact info and other personal identifiers. Apple will tell you if it will track your purchases, browsing history, contact info or financial info, too. IOS 14 will also include a small circle at the top right of your iPhone if an app is using your microphone or camera. App Clips. These are miniature apps that can be launched through the web or a text message. App Clips are not full apps -- they’re just meant for quick use in specific situations.  If you’re at Panera buying lunch, for example, you might tap your phone to an NFC tag or scan a bar code to open a mini Panera",error,513
1568," that the total cost of its app was expected to top £35 million.  But American governments can take advantage of apps built in countries such as Ireland and Canada because the code for those apps is available online and free to use and has already been deployed to millions of people. Instead of building the apps from scratch, they merely have to customize an open-source app with specific local health information, graphics and languages, and don’t have to reinvent complicated code for measuring Bluetooth signals or write privacy policies and other legal notices from scratch.  New York and New Jersey’s apps are based on Covid Green, Ireland’s app, which the government open-sourced in July. The apps for the two states and Pennsylvania were built by NearForm, the original developer of Ireland’s app. “What that does is gives people like in New York the confidence to go, ’Hey, this solution has been out there one of the longest, it’s tried and tested, it’s getting adoption levels, citizens seem to like it,” said Larry Breen, chief commercial officer at NearForm. “You’re not trying things for the first time. So people have typically gone before you on the fundamentals.” Another factor aiding momentum is the fact that U.S. apps are now finally able to talk to each other.  The U.S. does not have a national app strategy, unlike other countries, so the development of the apps falls to the state level. One concern with early apps was that they would not be able to communicate with other exposure notification apps — so, for instance, if someone with a Virginia app tested positive for Covid-19 and was close to someone with the North Carolina app, the system wouldn’t be able to ascertain the connection, and the person with the North Carolina app wouldn’t get a notification. But the apps from New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania will all be able to exchange notifications, Cuomo said this week. Connecticut will also be supported when it’s released.  This is possible because the Association for Public Health Laboratories set up a national key server in July, which gives the states the ability to all participate in a single system with different apps, instead of each state maintaining its own back end. “This is really the key to interoperability in the United States at this point, because what that means is that anybody who reports themselves as positive, rather than uploading that",error,513
1568," set of keys to their own state, they’re uploading it to the national key server,” said Jenny Wanger, head of the Implementer’s Forum at the Linux Foundation Public Health, a nonprofit that hosts the Covid Green code and provides assistance to agencies working on exposure notifications.  Now the apps face the biggest challenge yet: getting people to download and install them. Ireland’s app, which New York and New Jersey are based on, has an active user base of 1.3 million, or about 35% of the adult population. Virginia’s app was the first to be released in the United States, and it was downloaded 460,000 times in its first month, amounting to 11% of the state’s population with a smartphone, Gov. Ralph Northam said in September.  By way of comparison, New York’s app had been downloaded approximately 250,000 times by Friday afternoon, a Cuomo spokesperson said. New Jersey’s app had been downloaded more than 63,000 times on Friday, according to a tracker inside the app. Some users may be repelled by privacy considerations, even though Apple and Google designed the system with privacy in mind.  Apps created with the technology don’t collect or store any personal information such as the user’s phone number or location. Instead, every phone with a Covid alert app sends out Bluetooth Low Energy signals to detect if two people were close together for an extended period of time. Every day, each phone in the system downloads a list of anonymous tokens corresponding to positive tests, and compares them with tokens on the phone collected when the user was near another person for a certain period of time. For instance, New York’s app marks an exposure when two people were within six feet for 10 minutes. But those privacy provisions won’t matter if people don’t know about or believe in them. The system is technical and difficult to explain briefly. Some people have advanced conspiracy theories about the software on social media based on the system’s settings inside iPhone or Android software. Users who test positive also must enter a six-digit code to alert others, and governments can’t force them to do so. “If you don’t have a really strong user awareness and public trust rollout strategy to go with it, your app is not going to see great success,” Wanger said.  States such as Virginia have dealt with these problems by emphasizing",error,513
1573,", raised a number of questions around Apple’s new 5G technology. “We’ve been a little bit more skeptical on the iPhone side for the last few years here. It’s been a time since they’ve had a real hit. Remember that the 10 was supposed to be a supercycle as well. We didn’t really see it so we’ve seen a lot of changes as far as customers’ willingness to pay really since that iPhone 10 so there’s been a lot more mixing down and of course now really the new feature here is 5G. … When we have a new technology, we struggle with – is it worth the cost? Are there applications? What’s it going to do with my battery? What will the coverage look like?” Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money,’ explained weakness in the share price after Tuesday’s event. “I think the phone is a surprise. I think that the fact the stock was down was because it was up 6% the day before [on Monday] which is stupid. That’s those people. … They’re like, ‘Oh, there is a big unveiling. I’ll buy the stock beforehand and then I will profit.’” Nilay Patel, editor in chief of The Verge, is skeptical about the uses of 5G. “In the middle of Apple’s pitch for 5G, they announced a feature called Smart Data Mode … the thing that Smart Data Mode does for you is it turns 5G off to save battery life. So not only is the network not ready, the hardware, because the networks are new and the modems are new, is going to drain your battery life if you overuse 5G. So the phone itself unless you’re doing something that demands a lot of speed is going to turn 5G off almost most of the time. I did not see a single compelling use case for 5G in that entire presentation, other than the speed test app.” Krish Sankar, senior research analyst at Cowen, said 5G could give a boost to this upgrade cycle. “I would say in terms of the overall event a lot of the specs are largely in line with what the supply chain had been telegraphing for a long time. I thought the price point was very attractive although there was some speculation of the",error,513
1575,"�re using the phone. The common 5G network most people will see most often right now is sometimes faster than LTE. It can also sometimes be slower than 4G LTE. But, as long as you’re on 5G, the iPhone 12 will let you do things that earlier iPhones needed Wi-Fi for. That meant FaceTime in HD, which was noticeably clearer than over LTE. It’ll also download software updates and play videos from the Apple TV app at the highest possible quality. Anyway, this is the sort of experience you should mostly expect right now if you’re covered by 5G. Then there’s another flavor of faster 5G that’s still being built out but will eventually offer speeds many times faster than 4G LTE both indoors and outdoors. This is when you’ll see big differences in movie and TV show download times and when 5G will really start to matter. I think I ran into some of T-Mobile’s new network in Livingston, New Jersey, where I saw speeds about twice as fast as I did at home on slower 5G. And finally there’s the really fast 5G that’s bragged about the most. Verizon is the most bullish on this, though T-Mobile and AT&T are also building it. It’s mostly in cities. I’ve tested in Manhattan on other phones when I was able to download movies and TV shows in seconds but didn’t come across it on the iPhone 12 in the New Jersey suburbs, where it has yet to roll out. The fastest flavor of 5G is as finicky as it is speedy: You need to be outside and basically on the same street corner as the tower. It’ll matter one day for things that need really fast and low-latency connections, like maybe if self-driving cars ever launch and need to stop on a dime. But, for now, consider yourself lucky if you happen to have it in your backyard. Otherwise it’s a bit like a treasure hunt trying to find it, and it doesn’t matter much for most people. Mostly, we’re still waiting for developers to show us what we can do with 5G. One thing I’m excited for is cloud gaming. Amazon’s new Luna service will let you stream popular console games to your iPhone, for example. Apple hasn’t yet worked out deals with Google and Microsoft to allow their",error,513
1575," competing services in their current form, though. The good news is you don’t really have to worry about 5G on the iPhone. It has an auto-detect option that will use 5G most of the time but can smartly switch to 4G LTE if you’re doing something like streaming music in your pocket and it thinks 5G will hurt battery life. I didn’t see this happen, since it does this when the screen isn’t on. You can always just force your phone to stay on 5G or on 4G LTE, too, in case 4G LTE is still faster where you live. (Pro tip: I use the SpeedTest app to try this. Make sure your Wi-Fi is off.) So, that’s 5G. The bottom line is you don’t have to worry about it too much now, but you’ll be in a good spot in a few years once the networks are more capable. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more alike than the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. I often had a hard time telling the new models apart until I looked at the cameras on the back. The first thing you’ll notice on the new iPhones is the super bright and colorful screen. It’s probably one of the highlight features outside of 5G. And, this year, Apple gave the regular iPhone 12 an OLED screen, instead of the LCD panel it used on the iPhone 11. It’s just way, way better than LCD and matters for things such as viewing pictures, playing games and watching movies. A scene in “Mad Max: Fury Road” where a car explodes in a dust storm really stood out, since the orange flames contrast so well against the black smoke in the sky. The stereo speakers are great for watching movies, too. They sound full and get really loud. I love the new blue color I reviewed. The iPhone 12 also comes in pale green, red, black and white. It has a premium feel, and is made from glass and aluminum. I love how light it is without feeling cheap. I asked Apple about the throwback design, which is similar to 2010′s iPhone 4 (and the current iPad Pro and iPad Air) with flat edges and sharper corners. Apple said it helps the phone’s durability if it drops. And while I didn’t drop the phone to find out, Apple also claims the new “Ceramic Shield",error,513
1575,"” glass on the front is four times more resistant to damage from drops. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are more water resistant and can survive under 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I don’t shower with my phones, but you could if you wanted to. Most new phones have excellent cameras. Google and Samsung phones always impress me. But it comes down to personal preference, and I still prefer the pictures and videos from an iPhone. I took the iPhone 12 out for a walk in the park over the weekend and loved how both the regular wide-angle and the ultra-wide-angle lenses captured lots of detail and accurate colors, from the hair on my dog Mabel to trees against a deep blue sky. The front-facing selfie camera is still great, but you can see here it missed one arm of my sunglasses. Apple improved pictures shot at night, too, and also offers better selfies without flash even if it’s really dark out. Sometimes they were still a little blurry, though, so get a tripod or prop your iPhone on something sturdy to avoid that. Portrait shots in the day still look the best. My dog, Mabel, for example: The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the first phones to support recording video in “Dolby Vision” HDR. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I tried it. Video recorded in HDR at 4K and 30 frames per second looks great. Dolby Vision helped brighten areas that were otherwise washed out or dark, even in my relatively dim living room with a few table lamps. You don’t have to think about it or fiddle with settings, though, your videos will just look better. The iPhone 12 Pro supports Dolby Video HDR at 4K and a smoother 60 frames per second. Battery life is great. I took the iPhone 12 off the charger at about 7:34 a.m. and it still had a 51% charge at 5 p.m. That’s with a lot of use on 5G networks and the screen at about 75% brightness. I think light users will get through more than a day of use before having to charge, though I still regularly charge my iPhone at night when I go to bed and Apple promises a full day of use. That’s impressive for such a thin phone and, if you need it, you can get up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20-watt charger. Finally",error,513
1575,", the iPhone 12 feels really fast. It has a new A14 Bionic processor that helps with all sorts of things, like opening large games quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro Max to improving the photos and videos. I didn’t run into anything that felt sluggish on the iPhone. Games looked about as good as they did on my iPhone 11, although developers can probably make them even better with the added graphics performance. But it’s still pretty wild how some games, like “Genshin Impact” have huge worlds with great graphics. Now for some bad news. There’s no plug in the box, just the cable with a new type of connector at the bottom based on USB-C. Apple says it’s doing this to cut down its carbon footprint. The more cynical take: Apple’s decision not to include the plug forces you to buy a new one from the company because it has that USB-C connector, not the regular USB port you’re used to seeing on Apple’s plugs since 2007. There’s a small chance you have the necessary USB-C plug already in your house, or a computer with USB-C ports that can charge the phone. This is a great way for Apple to boost its revenue by about $20 for most iPhone 12s it sells. But it’s a bad experience for you. So what should you buy so you can actually charge your new iPhone 12? I recommend you get Apple’s $20 20-watt USB-C power adapter or Anker’s similarly priced 20-watt charger from Amazon. Take everything I talked about with the iPhone 12 and then add a few things and you have the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Pro is made out of steel instead of aluminum, which is heavier but looks a bit nicer. The back is matte and doesn’t attract fingerprints like the iPhone 12. There’s an extra telephoto lens that works great. It helps you zoom in without losing quality in your pictures. And speaking of pictures, the new lidar sensor helps with depth, which means even more accurate portrait shots, where the background is blurred and the subject is in focus. That means you can take pictures like this wide-angle: And this ultra-wide: And this 2x telephoto, which you don’t get on the iPhone 12: And the iPhone 12 Pro has support for portrait pictures at night, something the iPhone 12 lacks.",error,513
1575," It worked well when I tested it with a clock in my office at night. It was almost completely dark, but the iPhone still took this picture without flash: It’s not perfect, though. Notice the handle of the clock is still blurry. Here’s another night portrait picture of flowers. Again, it was totally dark outside: That lidar sensor does double duty for augmented reality. AR lets you drop digital objects on top of the real world. Sometimes it’s really cool, like if you’re using Wayfair to buy furniture and want to know if a couch will fit in your room before you buy it. The lidar sensor quickly generates a mesh map of the room you’re in, so you can accurately place a painting, drop a pool table in your kitchen or a tile swatch on the wall to see if something fits. The regular iPhone 12, which doesn’t have a lidar sensor, makes you wave your phone’s camera around the room for about 10 seconds before you can plop an object down. And the lidar sensor helps with accuracy for things such as measuring. I used it on a measuring tape to check its accuracy and it nailed it. This is useful if you want to use your iPhone’s measuring app to see the length, width or height of something. I don’t think anyone can top Apple when it comes to video recording on a phone. The Dolby Vision HDR support I talked about on the regular iPhone 12 works at up to 60 frames per second, which means even smoother 4K recording while maintaining the really good accuracy between bright and dark parts of your scene. People who film and edit with their iPhones will dig this. Normal folks might not care about the added smoothness on the 12 Pro, but they’ll get a version of it in the regular iPhone 12, too. Speaking of HDR, the screen gets a bit brighter on the iPhone 12 Pro than it does on the iPhone 12, but only when HDR is in use. So, it has a greater peak brightness when needed. I didn’t see a discernible difference in battery life between the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro, likely because they share so many of the same components. Expect all-day battery life. Lastly, if you want a larger 6.7-inch screen, then you have to get the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It’ll ship in November, when the smaller iPhone 12 Mini also launches. The",error,513
1575," iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro use a fun new “MagSafe” magnetic accessory system. The name was first used back when Apple’s MacBook chargers had magnets that held them in place. MagSafe is used for wireless charging and for sticking accessories to the back of your iPhone. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro still work with regular wireless charging pads, but they’ll juice up twice as fast — 15 watts instead of 7.5 watts — with the MagSafe charger. It magnetically sticks to the back of the phone. MagSafe works well, though I wish the charging puck didn’t slide off tables so easily. Apple partners such as Belkin are building some pretty nice stands, though, and Apple says more MagSafe products are coming. Apple’s new cases work with MagSafe, too, so the wireless charging puck still attaches even if you have a case on. You can attach things like a new leather wallet to the back of the iPhone 12, though I found that the magnet wasn’t strong enough to keep the wallet on while it was sliding around in in my pocket. Oh, and the MagSafe charger works with older iPhones that have wireless charging, they just don’t attach magnetically. MagSafe is a fun new system. It’ll probably help drive accessory revenue even more for Apple. I’m excited to see what Apple and its partners bring in the future. I think most people shopping for a phone right now should choose the iPhone 12, and I expect that will be the most popular model. It’s the one I ordered, though part of me wonders if maybe I’ll like the bigger iPhone 12 Pro Max better. We’ll see when that launches in November. The iPhone 12 has great cameras, an awesome screen, excellent battery life and future-proofs you with 5G. If you want some extra camera tricks, lidar for augmented reality and better portrait photos, and a more premium design, check out the iPhone 12 Pro. If you want something smaller, maybe wait for the $699 iPhone 12 Mini. Likewise, wait for the $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max if you want even better zoom cameras and a bigger screen. I’m excited to check those out. If you want to save money, consider the $599 iPhone 11, which is still great but doesn’t have as nice of a screen, the latest processor or 5G. This year’s",error,513
1576,", more convenient for charging and feels better on the screen than the first-generation Apple Pencil, which works on the base model iPad. A new feature in iPadOS 14 is really fun: you can use the pencil to write in any text box, whether it’s in an email, a group chat on iMessage or a URL in the web browser. It seems silly, but I liked using it for jotting out messages to friends instead of trying to stretch my hands across the screen. And the handwriting recognition is pretty good most of the time... until I got tired and my handwriting turned to gibberish. The Air also works with Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which is the best tablet keyboard. It’s $299, which is almost the cost of the entry-level iPad and super expensive, but it’s easy to type on and use. I bought one for my iPad Pro when it launched and, even though my work system isn’t compatible with the iPad, I use it all the time for emails, web surfing and Slack. If all the apps you need for work are available for iPad, this turns it into a real computer. The iPad Air has Apple’s newest and fastest A14 Bionic processor, the same that’s in Apple’s iPhone 12. I don’t really see a huge difference between the performance of it and the A12 Bionic in the regular iPad for apps and games, but I think developers will start to take more advantage of it and we’ll see more impressive games in the coming years. Battery life was great. I was able to get a full day of use if I had it on straight through, but usually it lasted a couple days when I turned to it more sparingly. I typically use an iPad after the work day is through, and just stream music while watching videos, browsing Twitter and catching up on news. iPadOS, if you haven’t used it in a while, is great for running multiple apps side by side. Finally, the front camera for FaceTime video chat on the iPad Air is clearer than the one on the front of the regular iPad. That’s important now if you’re spending a lot of time on video chat for work or to stay in touch with family. It’s kind of funny how the front-facing cameras on iPads are generally better than the 720p cameras on even high-end MacBooks. The fingerprint reader works",error,513
1576," fine in the power button for unlocking the iPad and buying stuff online through Apple Pay. But the iPad Air doesn’t have the more advanced and secure Face ID system that’s included in the iPad Pro. Face ID is more convenient for unlocking since you just look at the iPad. Also, without the Face ID sensor, you don’t get some of the fun little features, like Animoji or Memoji that react to your facial expressions. It’s a small thing, but if you’re buying a tablet for your kids they might like that. I wish Apple placed it in the middle of the side instead of at the top: most of the time I’m doing video chats with a keyboard attached or while holding it in landscape mode. That means I need to remember to look to the left of the iPad, instead of the middle where the camera usually is on a laptop. The screen isn’t as smooth as the display on the iPad Pro, which has a faster refresh rate to make things like scrolling much smoother. It’s not something you’ll miss if you’ve never used it, but I’d love to see it in the iPad Air line at some point. And, another thing you miss from the iPad Pro: there are stereo speakers, which are good. But the iPad Pro has four stereo speakers that offer even better sound. Still, the iPad Air beats the sound you get from the entry-level iPad. And you’re going to need to spend a lot of money to take full advantage of the iPad Air. The Magic Keyboard is $299 and the second-generation Apple Pencil is another $129. All-in, that’s $1,027. I think the iPad Air fits great right in the middle of Apple’s tablet family. It’s a good choice if you don’t need everything on an iPad Pro, like the fancy cameras and faster screen, but also want a better screen, speakers and design than you get on the entry-level iPad.

1582," shift more of their budgets to other apps and services where they can see the exact return on investment for their ads.  Facebook is the number-two recipient of online ad dollars, behind Google. One particular threat is that advertisers will pour more money into Google’s search ad business, which Facebook cannot duplicate, and which targets users at the time of conversion. In terms of specific businesses, the IDFA change will particularly hurt its Audience Network.  The Facebook Audience Network provides advertisements in non-Facebook apps, and it uses IDFA numbers to determine the best ads to show to each user based on Facebook’s data. For instance, a soft drink maker could decide to target 18-to-34-year-old gamers in the San Francisco Bay Area with a new promotion. The company could use the Facebook Audience network to have those ads placed before the right audience within mobile games; Facebook would split the ad revenue with the game makers. But if users opt out of IDFA tracking, all of that personalization Facebook has built will be rendered irrelevant outside of the company’s own apps. In August, Facebook acknowledged that Apple’s upcoming iOS 14 could lead to a more than 50% drop in its Audience Network advertising business. Nearly all of Facebook’s revenue comes from advertising, but Facebook’s Audience Network contributes only a small portion of that -- well less than 10% of the company’s net revenue, a person familiar with the numbers told CNBC. Besides view-through conversions, Facebook may lose valuable data about what its iPhone-based users do on their devices when they’re not in Facebook-owned apps. Already, Facebook collects a lot of data about its users from its apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and others, but every additional bit of data makes its algorithms better at what they do, which includes ad targeting.  Although Apple is letting users decide if they want to opt into IDFA tracking, it will still allow app-makers and advertisers to collect some data through its SKAdNetwork API without explicit user permission. But the information shared will be much less granular -- Facebook has warned in developer documents that it won’t support breakdowns of activity in buckets like region, age, or gender, for instance. Facebook knows that it won’t be able to convince Apple to change its mind regarding IDFA, but it has pushed forward with this campaign in support of small businesses anyway. Why? Reputation repair",error,513
1582," could be one reason. Facebook’s reputation has been in the gutter since the March 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a data firm improperly accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and used it to target ads for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.  Since then, Facebook has endured numerous scandals, it has alienated Democrats and Republicans and it has fought a never-ending battle against misinformation on its services.  By taking the moral high ground and saying that it is standing up for small businesses, the IDFA debate presents an opportunity for Facebook to rebuild goodwill, even if it’s with just a portion of the general public, one former Facebook employee said.  In addition, IDFA tracking isn’t going away -- users will simply have to choose to allow it. This means that Facebook and other app developers will have an opportunity to plead their case to every Apple user.  Facebook’s marketing campaign is a key part of its case. The company wants users to associate device tracking with personalized ads and with supporting small business. “Don’t opt in for Facebook, do it for the coffee shop you care about,” is the essence of the message.  Within a small subset of its users, Facebook has begun showing prompts asking them to opt into the IDFA tracking. This is what’s known as A/B testing. Among tech companies, A/B testing is a popular strategy for figuring out the most effective way to do something. In this case, Facebook can show different prompts to different users to determine which prompt will be the best at convincing the most people to opt into the IDFA tracking.  Asked if the IDFA change will actually impact small businesses as Facebook claims it will, the former employees gave mixed answers. With less tracking data available at its disposal, Facebook and all of its clients, including small businesses, will not be able to target ads as effectively as they once did. So in that sense, yes, small businesses will be affected.  However, for many small businesses, the change may not be noticeable at all.  If you’re a small coffee shop in Austin, Texas, for example, you may not need too much data to target your ads, said Henry Love, a former employee on Facebook’s small business team. A business like that typically limits its targeting to fairly broad categories -- for instance, an age range and a distance range from a specific zip code would let them target ads to Facebook users in their",error,513
1587," to sidestep many of the current issues around ad targeting, Bernstein analysts said in a note this week.  “It’s likely that Twitter may deliver revenue guidance at the top of their peer group,” they wrote.  J.P. Morgan analysts said last week that Twitter was one of their top picks because of sharp ad revenue acceleration, solid engagement with product improvements in areas like “topics” and its prioritization of revenue products. They also cited the company’s increased pace of development velocity and innovation and activist pressure driving “operational discipline.”  “Industry checks suggest the online ad market remains strong—supporting an increasingly digital economy — and we believe TWTR is benefiting from the return of events & launches, brand advertising ramping, & growth in MAP advertisers including in sports betting, crypto, & investing,” they wrote. Bank of America analysts said Twitter’s MAP, or direct-response, product ramp remains a big opportunity. They added that the Olympics will be a revenue generator the third quarter, but IDFA changes could be a bigger headwind in the third quarter than in the second.  “IFDA related caution in guidance remains a 3Q risk for [the] entire sector, though ad checks suggest risk is contained for brand advertisers,” they wrote.   Bank of America analysts expect second-quarter revenue of $845 million for Snap, up 86% year-over-year, above management guidance and in-line with street estimates. They said that deceleration may be a sentiment headwind for the third quarter ahead, in part because of tougher comps and an expected tougher impact from Apple’s privacy changes.  “Guidance remains our big question mark as a slowing retail ad spend market may continue to be offset by historically strong back-to-school ad spend season and continued brand spend ramp for Snapchat,” Bernstein analysts wrote. “There’s also a lot of investor excitement around monetizing Spotlight and Maps, though we also urge a bit of caution and don’t expect much revenue contribution from those platforms in the near-term.”   J.P. Morgan analysts added that while iOS 14.5 is a concern and is embedded within guidance, they believe bigger platforms are managing through. They said they expect upside to the high end of revenue guidance of 80-85%.  Jefferies analysts said they believe analysts’ second quarter revenue estimates are",error,513
1587," too conservative since ad demand from previously depressed verticals (like travel or movies) have exceeded prior expectations. They said their ad checks have also found iOS 14 privacy headwinds haven’t materially impacted budgets.  Morgan Stanley analysts seem similarly unbothered by the impact of iOS 14, saying that though there will be some near-term “bumps” they will be “fully manageable.” They model 54% ad revenue growth in the second quarter, 4% above street estimates.  “While we are hearing of some nearterm IDFA-related attribution challenges (and some dollars moving away from FB in 2H budgeting) we are not hearing of any material FB auction market pricing weakness, speaking to the ad durability that 10mn+ advertisers on FB can bring,” they wrote.  Evercore ISI analysts said in a note last week they view the consensus revenue growth estimate of 49% year-over-year in the quarter as potentially conservative. They cited figures from Branch Metrics saying that fewer than 33% of iOS users have opted into tracking since the April Apple update, with 70% of iOS devices using the most recent version as of late June. They also cited figures from Tinuiti saying that they’ve seen client spend on iOS fall and Android spend rise between June and July.  “It remains unclear how this update has impacted overall ad spend across Google and Facebook, but our belief is the update has been immaterial to date,” they wrote.  Bernstein analysts said they expect sequential growth for Google led by a continued recovery in travel and fasted-than-expected return of Google Maps offsetting any softness in retail-related searches.  “YouTube should also experience modest sequential revenue growth led by brand spend tied to Connected TV, while the Network business should have another exceptional quarter led by ad dollar rotation into Android from iOS, though these gains are temporary,” they wrote.  Evercore analysts said they see the street’s ad revenue growth estimate of a 1% quarter-on-quarter decline as potentially conservative. They forecast $57.1 billion in revenue, slightly above street estimates. They said the strength in online ad demand has persisted. “We believe Google’s exposure to Travel and strong positioning in Local (i.e., physical stores) will provide tailwinds for ad revenue growth under a reopening scenario,” they wrote.  Amazon made its first-ever presentation at the IAB New",error,513
1606,"s the largest contributor to the division’s 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances, a figure that Goldman said would nearly double to $30 billion by 2024. But rising losses threaten to mar that picture. Lenders deem bad loans “charge-offs” after a customer misses payments for six months; Goldman’s 2.93% net charge-off rate is double the 1.47% rate at JPMorgan’s card business and higher than Bank of America’s 1.60%, despite being a fraction of those issuers’ size. Goldman’s losses are also higher than that of Capital One, the largest subprime player among big banks, which had a 2.26% charge-off rate. “If there’s one thing Goldman is supposed to be good at, its risk management,” said Jason Mikula, a former Goldman employee who now consults for the industry.  “So how do they have charge-off rates comparable to a subprime portfolio?” The biggest reason is because Goldman’s customers have been with the bank for less than two years on average, according to people with knowledge of the business who weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Charge-off rates tend to be highest during the first few years a user has a card; as Goldman’s pool of customers ages and struggling users drop out, those losses should calm down, the people said. The bank leans on third-party data providers to compare metrics with similar cards of the same vintage and is comfortable with its performance, the people said. Other banks also tend to be more aggressive in seeking to recover debt, which improves competitors’ net charge-off figures, the people said. But another factor is that Goldman’s biggest credit product, the Apple Card, is aimed at a broad swath of the country, including those with lower credit scores. Early in its rollout, some users were stunned to learn they had been approved for the card despite checkered credit histories. “Goldman has to play in a broader credit spectrum than other banks, that’s part of the issue,” said a person who once worked at the New York-based bank, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about his former employer. “They have no direct-to-consumer offering yet, and when you have the Apple Card and the GM card, you are looking at Americana.” After the",error,513

And it feels less seamless since Apple TV will push you out into that separate app instead of playing the content right away. A new “What to Watch” screen inside the Apple TV app provides curated content from Apple editors that’s based on what’s popular around the world. Apple said it’s using human editors combined with its algorithms to make recommendations so users don’t sit and endlessly scroll trying to find something good to watch. It’s a problem most of us have experienced with the influx of streaming content now available. When you select a show, Apple provides data on who stars in it and a summary of the episode or movie and will begin automatically playing the trailer at the top of the screen. It looks really clean and provides most of what a person browsing for a new TV show or movie might want. There’s also a new kids section with content curated for a younger audience. This includes lots of animated movies and TV shows that users can either stream, download or buy, depending on whether it’s included with one of the subscriptions in Apple TV Channels. There’s also an option to download content and save it for offline viewing on an iPhone or iPad when you don’t have an internet connection. This will help Apple TV Channels stand out against standalone apps from HBO, Showtime and others that require an internet connection for viewing. This, above all else, might make it one of the most compelling reasons to sign up for a service through Apple TV Channels instead of elsewhere. Apple Channels won’t be limited to just Apple products. The company announced a partnership with Samsung in January in which select Samsung Smart TVs will have access to the new Apple TV app. It won’t offer the full experience of an Apple TV, which also supports apps and games, but it will provide the same experience for watching TV shows and movies. The Samsung app will also launch Monday on all 2019 smart TV models and some 2018 models. Apple TV will launch on Amazon’s Fire TV, Sony TVs, LG TVs and Roku devices later this year.

1619," increasingly available on television sets from competitors like Samsung, and Apple said in the spring that its streaming service, Apple TV+, will go on sale this fall. Tweet It will also be a good place to look for clues whether the Mac platform might become secondary to iOS going forward.  Last year, the company previewed a new set of developer tools that would enable iPhone apps to run on Mac computers with minimal effort. Apple uses the technology for some of its own apps that have jumped from the iPhone to the Mac, such as News or Memos. Developers are worried that if the two platforms become more closely linked, that software will be primarily developed for iPhone and then ported to Mac, potentially robbing the desktop version of power-user features. “Are you merging iOS and MacOS? No,” read a bold-faced slide at last year’s WWDC. Developers will be watching closely to see if that’s still true. The one platform that might be gaining in stature is watchOS, which runs on the Apple Watch. According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple may introduce a new app store for Apple Watch, providing a new way to for developers to make money from watch apps.  iOS 13 will reportedly have a slew of new features for users, including a dark mode, improved one-handed keyboard, and improvements to apps like Mail, Health, and iMessage, according to reports from Bloomberg and 9to5Mac. If past years are any guide, the new software will be available for beta-testers later this summer, and will launch for everyone alongside new iPhones in the fall. Many of the reported system-wide improvements are subtle, including improved performance and a new feature in Screen Time. Apple is expected to redesign the “share sheet” that enables people to send photos and information from inside of apps. iPads are expected to get particular attention, including a new feature that lets Mac users use the iPad as a second monitor, and a better multi-tasking tinerface. Apple’s own apps are expected to get a lot of attention this year. The Health, Reminders, Books, and Find My Friends apps are all expected to get a redesign, according to Bloomberg. Don’t expect a lot of new hardware at WWDC. No new hardware was released at WWDC last year, but 2017′s conference included the introduction of the HomePod smart speaker and the iMac Pro desktop. “History suggests investor disappointment will follow the event given the likely absence of",error,513
1626," greater emphasis on privacy. Another popular announcement was SwiftUI, a new programming framework that drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to write a new app. SwiftUI is still in an early stage, with many developers saying they didn’t plan to use it for years, but one programmer has already published an online tutorial book about the two-day old technology. Many developers believe Apple’s developer tools and devices enable them to make apps for iOS that aren’t possible on other platforms. “When it comes to new user experiences, and particularly creative user experiences that require user experience innovation, we always start at iOS. The main reason is that the platform is much more curated and you’re dealing with a more refined set of APIs and devices, so you can drive for a higher performance point there,” WeTransfer Chief Innovation Officer Georg Petschnigg told CNBC before the show started. He’s developed a lot of iOS apps, but recently launched a new app to tap into Android’s larger user base. Apple’s platforms target a much smaller variety of devices and have fewer versions in use than Google Android, making them easier to develop for. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook mentioned this advantage during a speech on Monday when he said the “other guys” — Google — only has 10% of users on the most recent version of Android. “Ultimately, I felt that iOS had fewer form factors. Android, you have a huge amount of hardware, and even on the minimum OS version, it’s like, what do you choose? Those are the kind of trade-offs you have to think about,” said Jesse Chor, the head of mobile for Splunk. He recently headed up the development of a Splunk Connected Experiences set of apps which are available for iPhone and Apple Watch, but not Android. “When you are on iPhone and you push a new app, 97% of your user base is on the newest version within 48 hours,” Mammoth Media founder Benoit Vatere told CNBC. His company develops two main apps, Wishbone and Yarn, for both Android and iOS. By way of response, Google said that it released new cross-platform developer tools at its developer conference earlier this year, and that it’s improving Android to make it easier to developers to target a wider range of versions of Android without doing extra work. One reason why Apple’s platform remains popular among developers is",error,513
1626," that its audience is willing to pay. Apple App Store users spent $46.6 billion around the world in 2018, app analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates. That’s 1.9 times what Google Play did last year. In the U.S. specifically, iPhone users spent $79 per device compared to the average Android user who bought $56 of apps, in-app purchases, and online services through Google Play. “According to our estimates, the world’s App Store users spent nearly twice as much in apps last year as Google Play’s did, despite the latter’s considerably larger market global market share,” Sensor Tower cofounder Alex Malafeev told CNBC. On a website launched the week before WWDC, Apple noted that it had paid over $120 billion to developers over the past 10 years. On that website it said that “even though other stores have more users and more app downloads, the App Store earns more money for developers.” “Revenue per user remains way stronger on Apple compared to Android,” Vatere agreed. Despite the positive atmosphere in San Jose, some developers expressed concerns about Apple’s dominance in hushed tones at the conference or at unofficial side-events held in adjoining hotels. Governments are placing more attention than ever on Apple’s control of its platforms and how it might compete with its own developers. The European Union is investigating a claim from Spotify that Apple disadvantaged it in favor of its own Apple Music service. Some developers who made parental control apps felt targeted by Apple’s App Store review process called “App Review” when Apple released a competing feature called Screen Time. Several developers said that the phenomenon of Apple making apps that compete with its own developers so old it has name: Sherlocking, after an obsolete piece of Apple software from the early 2000′s that competed with an app called Watson. The Verge put together a list of 9 apps that were Sherlocked at WWDC this year. One developer who saw Apple announce a competitive feature at WWDC said he wanted to continue making apps for Apple’s platforms, but that he might think about expanding into areas where big tech companies are unlikely to compete with him in the future. He didn’t want to be named because he has an ongoing relationship with Apple. Developers also expressed confusion with the App Review process, which can take a long time and often provides unhelpful boilerplate feedback when apps are rejected. “We�",error,513
1629," a stamp of approval from a human being in order to be distributed on Apple’s App Store. While Apple does use automated filters, people familiar with the department say it’s always relied on manual labor. Unlike content moderators at Silicon Valley companies such as Facebook or YouTube that rely on tens of thousands of contractors, Apple’s app reviewers work for Apple, people familiar with the process said. They’re paid hourly, have employee badges and get Apple benefits such as health care. Everyone starts out reviewing iPhone apps, and as reviewers become more senior, they are trained to evaluate apps with in-app purchases, subscriptions, Apple Watch and Apple TV. The department has more than 300 reviewers and is based out of a pair of offices in Sunnyvale, California — not Apple’s famous Apple Park campus or its older headquarters, Infinite Loop, people familiar with the offices said. Lots of reviewers are fluent in non-English languages, and some teams in the division specialize in individual languages. Apple says its reviewers speak 81 different languages. App Review is organized under the marketing umbrella at Apple and always has been, even before Schiller took over the greater App Store marketing and product departments in late 2015. Although Schiller is involved in decision-making through the ERB, people who worked at the App Review office said that he rarely if ever visits the office where the review takes place. According to people familiar with app review operations, day-to-day oversight mainly falls to a vice president at Apple, Ron Okamoto, and a director who joined Apple when it bought TestFlight in 2015, whom CNBC is not naming because of security reasons. Reviewers say they sometimes receive feedback from developers that can be threatening. App Review was developed shortly after the iPhone App Store was launched in 2008. Apple’s two goals for the department, according to a response to the FCC in 2009 and the webpage published earlier this year, is to create a store where customers can be confident that apps are safe and to provide a level playing field for developers to reach customers, in exchange for a 15% to 30% cut of sales. Reviewers “claim” a batch of apps through a web portal on a Mac desktop, called App Claim. They often examine the app on an attached iPad, even if it’s an iPhone app, although there are stations for reviewers to evaluate Watch and TV apps on those devices, people familiar with the process said. (Some developers have said they were surprised to see iPad screenshots of their",error,513
1629," iPhone apps in their logged communication with App Review.) Reviewers compare the app with Apple’s public App Store guidelines, including making sure it runs without crashing and isn’t full of illegal content. Then the reviewers make a call whether to accept, reject or hold the app. Most reviewers spend only a few minutes per app, but many apps are simple and only require a short period to evaluate, the people said. Reviewers have daily quotas of between 50 and 100 apps, and the number of apps any individual reviewer gets through in an hour is tracked by software called Watchtower, according to screenshots seen by CNBC. Reviewers are also judged on whether their decisions are later overturned and other quality-oriented stats. People who worked at App Review said that work days could be long, especially ahead of Apple’s annual release of its new version of iOS, when app developers update their apps so they’re compatible. One stat that is closely tracked at App Review is called SLA, which stands for service-level agreement. Apple aims for 50% of apps to be reviewed within 24 to 48 hours. When there’s a big queue of apps, the SLA percentage drops, according to reviewers who worked at Apple. On July 30 last year, the SLA fell to 6%, according to a staff email. “Until we catch up, we are opening up 12-hour days,” according to the email seen by CNBC. “Please note that you should not work over 12 hours in one day.” Reviewers generally don’t face horrific or illegal content on a regular basis, although one reviewer said that one time they discovered child pornography in a pending app. The app wasn’t approved and the incident was reported to the FBI, the reviewer said. The bigger concern is that developers can get angry that their livelihood can be threatened by a prolonged review process, and some reviewers wish they could share more details or help more beyond the boilerplate responses they are required to send, they said. Another reviewer said that sometimes they approve what looks like a valid app, but changes can be made on the developer’s server to make it into a scammy app that violates Apple’s guidelines. Sometimes reviewers get dinged for that, the person said. Forty percent of apps or updates submitted to Apple are rejected, the company says. Many of those are subsequently approved after minor changes, but others present a more difficult decision for App Review. Developers who disagree with a decision",error,513
1629," made by App Review can appeal to a board called the App Review Board, which can change the decision from a lower-level reviewer and is partially composed of reviewers with good track records, people who worked as reviewers said. Sustained appeals can bring an app in front of the Executive Review Board. The vast majority of iPhone apps are rejected for common reasons — they’re scammy, or they have bugs, or they violate user privacy. A lot of rejected apps are related to a Chinese gambling scam called “PK10,” or other obviously fraudulent submissions, according to people familiar with the process. But some rejections either fall into gray areas in Apple’s policies or they are publicly sensitive, and those go to the ERB, which includes Schiller and other VPs with responsibilities at the App Store, the people who worked at App Review said. The executive review board has been meeting since 2009, according to Apple’s letter to the FCC. The apps handled by the ERB are sometimes apps that could be dangerous for Apple in terms of publicity, or “oh s---” apps, according to a person familiar with the process. One notable app that was handled at the ERB last year was the Infowars app, according to people familiar with the situation. The conspiracy theory-broadcasting app was banned last year because it published videos that included threats to reporters. The App Review team had a staff meeting after that decision was made last year, a reviewer said. When a decision is overturned on appeal, or a rejection needs to be explained, somebody at Apple calls the developer, reviewers who worked at Apple said. Apple says it makes 1,000 calls per week to developers. Many developers, especially those who have gained public attention for their complaints about App Review, are contacted by a longtime Apple veteran who identifies himself as “Bill,” who doesn’t offer a last name, and whom CNBC is not identifying due to security reasons. Companies such as Spotify or Netflix don’t get special treatment, one reviewer said, with the same App Review process and rules applied to their apps, despite their size. For example, Bill called Spotify when an update was rejected because it was emailing customers asking them to pay Spotify directly to circumvent Apple’s cut, according to a person familiar with the situation. Bill also made calls related to the parental control apps that publicly complained about App Review treatment, according to a developer who received the call. Ultimately, at Apple,",error,513
1635," September 1998, when Ive’s run of memorable designs was just starting, Apple had 6,658 full-time employees. It’s tempting to see Apple’s products coming out of a single design mind, especially compared with other consumer technology companies. Founding CEO Steve Jobs was known as a great product mind and storyteller, and when he died in 2011, the majority of that public focus fell on Ive, who was close with Jobs. But in fact, Apple does not work that way. Apple’s a machine with thousands of parts, running on deadlines and meetings. It’s an army marching. It’s not the same company as it was even 10 years ago. Inside, the company’s culture promotes individual responsibility. At Apple, projects have what’s called a “directly responsible individual,” or a DRI, attached. That person is in charge of making sure that a feature or project gets completed on time. Jobs was the unofficial DRI for Apple’s products. After all, he was the decider. But Apple’s so large now that nobody can be the singular genius — the “DRI” — behind any given product. “Collaboration and teamwork are defining features of Apple’s success across the company,” Cook wrote in an internal email to Apple employees about Ive’s departure. Ive’s departure does not introduce any new risk that Apple will stop producing a new iPhone model every year or selling Mac computers. As the company’s announcement pointed out, Apple still has talented designers that can easily fill in and create the next iPhone or iPad design. Ive’s departure does introduce some risk: Apple has lost full-time access to a strong presence that helps it develop completely new product franchises, such as its reported augmented reality glasses or whatever it’s doing to develop an Apple car. “It adds to the sensitivity of investors around innovation at Apple,” Ives said. “If you think about the last years, it’s losing a bit of that golden touch on innovations on the hardware side.” But Apple’s stock has never really factored in the upside of another major product into its price. Instead, analysts mainly focus on iPhone sales, signals from Apple’s enormous supply chain and the overall economic environment — the waves around the company. Apple is a big ship, and",error,513

The iMac got new chips in March, most MacBook Pro laptops were updated this summer and the updated fan-favorite Mac Mini was unveiled last fall. For people who need high-end, extreme-performance workstations — animators, programmers and designers — Apple revealed a new Mac Pro desktop tower in June. It starts at $6,000 and some speculate that a fully maxed-out version will cost around the price of a new sedan. The Mac Pro isn’t available in stores yet, but when it goes on sale this fall, it will be over 2,000 days since it was last updated. That’s a six-year gap that many Apple fans vocally complained about. Apple is also supporting the Mac with new software features. For example, when Apple Arcade, the company’s gaming subscription, launches this fall, it will support Macs, not just iPhones, iPads and Apple TVs. The latest version of MacOS, called Catalina, is also seeing major changes and Apple resources dedicated to cleaning up old software that hadn’t been given a lot of attention in recent years. For example, the next version of MacOS won’t have iTunes, which had gotten bloated with lots of excess features over the years. Instead, it will have separate apps for music, podcasts and TV. You’ll also be able to sync your iPhone directly with your Mac without using iTunes. Apple also introduced a new feature that enables users to have a double-screen setup on the go by pairing an iPad to act as a MacBook’s second screen. Developers said at Apple’s conference in June that they were excited about a software development tool called Catalyst, which allows software developers to write code once and have it run on both iPhones and Macs, with the hope that some apps that were previously exclusive to the iPhone could be ported, creating a richer software ecosystem. One issue hanging over Apple’s Mac turnaround is the keyboard it uses on MacBooks. In 2015, Apple introduced a thinner kind of keyboard design, called the butterfly keyboard, which is now included standard on all Apple laptops. Critics say that the keyboards are unreliable, and prone to breaking when confronted with crumbs or dust. Apple said earlier this year that the “vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard.” While plugged",error,513

We see the potential for meaningful multiple expansion as new Services re-accelerate growth and Apple approaches the September 2020 launch of 5G iPhones, which have the potential to accelerate upgrades and return iPhone to meaningful Y/Y growth.” “Apple’s FY Q3 was solid. The company beat on revenues primarily due to very strong growth in AirPods, and notably improved performance in China. These positives were partly offset by Services and iPhone revenues coming in just below consensus. That said, the key driver of the stock’s positive after-market reaction was that Apple guided up expected FY Q4 revenues and gross margins, which are likely to trigger a ~5% increase to consensus FY Q4 EPS....The core controversy of normalized iPhone growth remains unresolved – recent price cutting has clearly helped, but we remind investors that iPhones are still down -12% YoY, with big questions about replacement cycles still outstanding;” “Against modest expectations, Apple delivered strong results and solid guidance - particularly in China as several factors are offsetting any brand backlash that might have resulted from the trade disputes. The only item to potentially feed a bearish narrative was services revenue that was a little light - but even this is still growing high teens constant FX. In the near-term, investor expectations for the Fall iPhone launch are appropriately low but even disappointing numbers the next few Qs just argue for an even bigger C2020 as we get 5G (multiple iPhone models) and the ramp of some potentially exciting new products (e.g. at least one foldable product and key new services like TV.” “Read this slowly and ponder it: Apple’s wearable, home, & accessory category is larger than iPad sales. This underscores a new theme that is starting to emerge from Apple, which we believe investors are overlooking and that is the diversity of Apple’s offerings.

1648," Gardens, and to a historic church and back. I was lucky to be able to make a reservation on Apple’s website — most sessions through the end of the month are already full. Of the six sessions scheduled at the store for next weekend, all are booked as of Monday. However, when I arrived, there was plenty of space. There were only five of us when we departed the store, including a store employee who came along for the walk on his free time. We were led by two Apple employees with a separate store manager checking in during the walk to troubleshoot our path. If there are open slots in a walk, Apple stores will accommodate people who are there, an Apple representative said, so even if you can’t get a reservation, it still may be worth seeing if there are open spaces. The walk is guided by an Apple store employee and everyone gets to borrow an iPhone XS Max and pair of Beats Solo headphones for the trip. You can’t use your personal iPhone. Each one of the the Apple-loaned iPhones has a non-public AR[T] app installed that enables you to access the experiences. There’s a bit of a ritual to see the art. The tour guide turned each experience on and off from an iPad Pro, and also led discussions about what we saw. We’d walk to a location, like Maiden Lane, a cute little alley in downtown San Francisco. Then, we were told to find and point our phones at a “marker” like a sign, which allows the phone to place digital objects and creatures in the real world by giving the phone a point to orient the graphics around. Once you scan the marker — feeling a little haptic pulse when it’s locked in — then you get a few minutes to walk around and experience the art. At the end of each art piece, the guide asked us to all put our loaner phones together, then the guide would press buttons on his iPad, and all the phones would shut off, turn to black, and we’d be asked to put it in our pockets so we could walk to the next location. The draw for the ART walks is six pieces of art selected by the New Museum, a modern art museum based in New York. The art is often interactive and sometimes challenging, although at times you’re reminded that augmented reality is a nascent medium that artists and other creators are still learning how to use. Seven artists, including Nick Cave",error,513
1648,", John Giorno and Pipilotti Rist, made six pieces for the walk. The first piece we saw was by Cave, and it included creating and customizing a floating ball of digital cloth that walks with you down the alley. At the end, you point your phone towards the sky, and through its screen you can see a giant man with a bowl for his head standing on top of a building. Bowl Man sucks up all the cloth balls, and he changes color. Another piece, by Cao Fei, places a little factory on the ground with a series of conveyor belts moving boxes into the distance. That piece was designed to be interactive — we could pinch or stretch individual boxes, or press a switch that reversed the flow of the boxes. Other pieces were less successful. One of them, called “Now at the Dawn of My Life” by Giorno, involved the words from a poem floating on a rainbow pathway through a park, which was difficult to navigate on a crowded Sunday while looking through a smartphone. Our guide mentioned we didn’t want to be the people engrossed in our phones running into other people, but that’s exactly who we were as we tried to experience the art. Apple’s ART walk isn’t the first time that a tech company has sponsored a piece of digital art placed into the real world through augmented reality technology. In 2017, Snap placed a giant Jeff Koons balloon animal in Central Park that could be viewed through Snapchat. That artwork was “vandalized” by Errazuriz, the graffiti artist, who placed a similar balloon animal in the same spot covered with graffiti tags, arguing at the time that corporations “should pay rent” in augmented reality and that citizens “should choose to approve what can be geo-tagged to our digital public and private space.” “As the technology becomes ubiquitous during the next couple of years, it will be important to stay alert to the permissions and responsibilities we allow for geo-located AR content in the future. So far Apple has proven trustworthy and responsible, I believe in them and their mission,” Errazuriz said to CNBC on Monday. The walks aren’t the only augmented reality-related programming Apple is scheduling at its stores. There’s a Cave piece that’s available in all stores, and a separate class to learn how to make augmented reality experiences. The walks will run at least through the end of 2019.",error,513
1659," and his wife found out, AI systems are becoming more commonplace in areas that everyday people rely on. This technology is not only being introduced in credit and job hiring but insurance, mortgages and child welfare. In 2016, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, introduced a tool called the Allegheny Family Screening Tool. It is a predictive-risk modeling tool that is used to help with child welfare call-screening decisions when concerns of child maltreatment are raised to the county’s department of human services. The system collected data on each person in the referral and uses it to create an “overall family score.” That score determines the likelihood of a future event. Allegheny did face some backlash, but one conclusion was that it created “less bad bias.” Other places, including Los Angeles, have used similar technology in an attempt to improve child welfare, and it is an example of how AI systems will be used in ways that can affect people in large ways, and as a result, it is important to know how those systems can be flawed. Most AI is created from a process called machine learning, which is teaching a computer something by feeding them thousands of pieces of data to help them learn the information of the data set by itself. An example would be giving an AI system thousands of pictures of dogs, with the purpose of teaching the system what a dog is. From there the system would be able to look at a photo and decide whether it is a dog or not based on that past data. So what if the data you are feeding a system is 75% golden retrievers and 25% Dalmations? Postdoctoral researcher at the AI Now Institute, Dr. Sarah Myers West, says these systems are built to reflect the data they are fed, and that data can be built on bias. “These systems are being trained on data that’s reflective of our wider society,” West said. “Thus, AI is going to reflect and really amplify back past forms of inequality and discrimination.” One real-world example: While the human manager-based hiring process can undoubtedly be biased, debate remains over whether algorithmic job application technology undoubtedly removes human bias. The AI learning process could incorporate the biases of the data they are fed — for example, the resumes of top-performing candidates at top firms. The AI Now Institute has also found biases in the people who are creating AI systems. In an April 2019 study, they found that only 15% of the AI staff at Facebook are",error,513
1659," women, and only 4% of their total workforce are black. Google’s workforce is even less diverse, with only 10% of their AI staff being women and 2.5% of their workers black. Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist at MIT, found during her research on a project that would project digital masks onto a mirror, that the generic facial recognition software she was using would not identify her face unless she used a white colored mask. She found that her system could not identify the face of a black woman, because the data set it was running on were overwhelmingly lighter-skinned. “Quite clearly, it’s not a solved problem,” West said. “It’s actually a very real problem that keeps resurfacing in AI systems on a weekly, almost daily basis.” AI algorithms are completely proprietary to the company that created them. “Researchers face really significant challenges understanding where there’s algorithmic bias because so many of them are opaque,” West said. Even if we could see them, it doesn’t mean we would understand, says co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project, and Shorenstein Fellow at Harvard University, Dipayan Ghosh. “It’s difficult to draw any conclusions based on source code,” Ghosh said. “Apple’s proprietary creditworthiness algorithm is something that not even Apple can easily pin down, and say, ‘Okay, here is the code for this,’ because it probably involves a lot of different sources of data and a lot of different implementations of code to analyze that data in different siloed areas of the company.” To take things a step further, companies like Apple write their code to be legible to Apple employees, and it may not make sense to those outside of the company. Right now there is little government oversight of AI systems. “When AI systems are being used in areas that are of incredible social, political and economic importance, we have a stake in understanding how they are affecting our lives,” West said. “We currently don’t really have the avenues for the kind of transparency we would need for accountability.” One presidential candidate is trying to change that. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker sponsored a bill earlier this year called “The Algorithmic Accountability Act.” The bill requires companies to look at flawed algorithms that could create unfair or discriminatory situations for Americans. Under the",error,513
1672," wireless analyst Jeff Kagan said. Perhaps the best example of the iPhone’s transformational power is what it did to the camera. Some 109 million pocket cameras were sold in 2010, according to data from the Camera & Imaging Products Association. But in 2018, the last year for which full data is available, only 9 million cameras with built-in lenses were sold. “Some products been absorbed, some have been completely removed from the marketplace, and that’s part of a free and open marketplace,” said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. The iPhone has also created arguably as many new industries as it destroyed. Ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber are collectively worth more than $60 billion, and they exist only thanks to the always-on GPS location and high-speed wireless connections that became common with the iPhone. “You can go through every feature of the phone and think of billion-dollar companies that have been created around them. It impacts almost every facet of our lives,” Munster said. “The camera and Instagram. Location does anything from maps, like Waze, to advertising on Google Maps, to food delivery like Grubhub. NFC has enabled mobile banking, which is going to change the banking industry. Content consumption is video consumption now. YouTube wouldn’t be YouTube now without the iPhone,” he said. The iPhone and its Apple-controlled App Store also became a massive business and gave app developers an easy way to sell to a global audience. In January, Apple said developers on its App Store platform had made $120 billion since it launched in 2008, with over $30 billion in 2018 alone. Although the core idea of the iPhone did not change during the decade, the device itself became significantly more powerful. At the start of the decade, the most powerful iPhone was the iPhone 3G, the second version of the device, featuring a slow Samsung CPU with one core running at 412 MHz. The iPhone 11 Pro, the latest major revision to the iPhone, comes equipped with an Apple-designed chip with a max speed of 2.65GHz in six cores. Modern iPhone performance rivals laptops, according to some tests. The same level of improvement happened to the display as well. A top-of-the-line iPhone in 2010 had a 3.5-inch screen with 153,000 pixels. The newest iPhones can come equipped with a 6.5-inch screen with over 2.6 million",error,513
1672," pixels. “Now that we’re on iPhone 11, if we went back and used the iPhone 1 or 2, it would be like going back to the Model T,” Kagan said. The downside is that iPhones also become more expensive, at least upfront. The iPhone 3G cost only $199 for the entry-level model, partially subsidized by a two-year AT&T contract. Apple’s Pro iPhones now start at $999, and the wireless contract is sold separately. Apple’s ability to deliver a new model every year with significantly improved capabilities was underpinned by a vast and sophisticated supply chain that culminated in massive assembly facilities in China run by Apple’s primary manufacturing partner, Foxconn. In 2017, Apple said it created and supported 4.8 million jobs in China. The parts that went into the iPhone and other smartphones — tiny cameras, dense batteries, high-quality touch screens — were cloned and eventually became common, enabling a generation of entrepreneurs to make new kinds of hardware products, such as drones, scooters and smart home products. When the decade started, Apple was led by founder Steve Jobs. On Aug. 24, 2011, two months before Jobs’ death, Tim Cook took over as CEO, and he’s been in charge ever since. Under Cook, Apple has sold sold billions of iPhones and raked in hundreds of billions of profit. At one point, it registered what was at the time the most profitable quarter for a publicly traded company ever. For much of the decade, Apple was the most valuable publicly traded company, only recently losing that crown briefly to longtime tech rival Microsoft and more recently, Saudi Aramco. For years, Apple grew a giant stash of cash and marketable securities on the back of its iPhone sales, but in 2018, after tax reform, it indicated it planned to distribute the majority of that wealth to its shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Those buybacks helped the stock price grow over 900% on a split-adjusted basis. A million dollars invested in Apple on Jan 1, 2010, would be worth over $9.13 million last Friday, after a 7-1 stock split in 2014. Along the way, Apple has crossed a few big landmarks. It joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2015, a symbol that Apple is a blue-chip stock and an industry standard-bearer. It got an endorsement from famously tech-shy investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway now owns over",error,513
1672," 5% of Apple. In 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded company to cross a $1 trillion market capitalization. “Financial returns are simply the result of Apple’s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,” Cook told Apple employees in a memo marking the occasion. It also opened a literal landmark in 2017: Apple Park, a giant corporate campus in its hometown of Cupertino, California, that cost an estimated $5 billion to build and now serves as the company’s headquarters. Apple also launched three major new product lines: the iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods. All have sold well. None has changed the world like the iPhone. Apple enters the next decade as a juggernaut with several massively profitable products. But it increasingly faces challenges related to its size and success. Recently, the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from Apple, along with Amazon, Facebook and Google, as part of an antitrust probe as the mood in Washington turns more skeptical of Big Tech. In recent months, Cook has had to answer questions from international press whether Apple is a monopoly, mainly based around its control of its App Store platform. “No reasonable person would ever call Apple a monopolist,” Cook said in October. There are also increasing concerns from activists and consumer advocates about the environmental cost of selling new hardware devices to hundreds of millions of people, who upgrade every few years. In recent years, Apple has introduced new recycling programs and initiatives to reduce the waste going to landfills. Others, including former head Apple designer Jony Ive, have expressed fears that iPhones may be too good — and people can’t put them down. In response, Apple introduced a Screen Time feature to help people wean their addiction to the little glowing screen. “One turning point is when Apple introduced the Screen Time feature, and CEO Tim Cook said he was using his phone too much,” said Kaiwei Tang, co-founder of Light, a company that makes an iPhone alternative focused on limiting over-usage. “People are starting to see some of those metrics. It’s basic math, spending five hours a day on your phone, what else you might be able to do with that time?” he continued. But the biggest challenge might simply be that the iPhone was a once-in-a-generation product that cannot grow as briskly as it did over the last 10 years, when hundreds of millions of people got an",error,513
1684," will make it harder for them to track down instances of child exploitation, as they do now. Apple said it has provided the FBI with technical assistance in the Pensacola case that has not required it to build a backdoor to its encryption. Apple said it was only recently notified by the FBI about a second iPhone in the investigation that law enforcement needed help to access. After receiving a subpoena “for information related to the second iPhone,” on Jan. 8, Apple said it responded “within hours.” Apple pledged to continue working with the FBI. But unless the company agrees to provide a way for law enforcement to access encrypted devices, it seems clear Barr won’t be fully satisfied. “This situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that investigators be able to get access to digital evidence once they have obtained a court order based on probable cause,” Barr said in the speech Monday about the Pensacola case. “We call on Apple and other technology companies to help us find a solution so that we can better protect the lives of Americans and prevent future attacks.” Read Apple’s full response below: We were devastated to learn of the tragic terrorist attack on members of the US armed services at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida on December 6th.We have the greatest respect for law enforcement and routinely work with police across the country on their investigations. When law enforcement requests our assistance, our teams work around the clock to provide them with the information we have. We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation. Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing. Within hours of the FBIs first request on December 6th, we produced a wide variety of information associated with the investigation. From December 7th through the 14th, we received six additional legal requests and in response provided information including iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. We responded to each request promptly, often within hours, sharing information with FBI offices in Jacksonville, Pensacola and New York. The queries resulted in many gigabytes of information that we turned over to investigators. In every instance, we responded with all of the information that we had. The FBI only notified us on January 6th that they needed additional assistance a month after the attack occurred. Only then did we learn about the existence of a second iPhone associated with the investigation and the FBI’s inability to access either iPhone. It was not",error,513
1685," 2013 that the last major carrier, T-Mobile, finally started selling it. From there, the iPhone expanded around the globe, eventually landing its biggest prize in 2014 with China Mobile, the largest carrier in China, which had about 760 million subscribers at the time. Later that year, Apple kicked off a major “super cycle” of iPhone sales by breaking with its tradition and releasing two iPhone 6 models with larger screens that matched its rivals. The company sold 74.5 million iPhones in the fourth quarter alone. But that was just about the peak of iPhone sales, and doubts began to swirl about its ability to grow at such a massive scale. That’s where the next chapter in Cook’s story began. The iPhone was a once-in-a-generation product, and it would’ve been technically impossible to recreate that magic. The writing was on the wall, and Cook formed a new path for growth outside the iPhone. Today, Apple talks about its growing suite of services more than anything else. The segment includes products like iCloud storage, App Store sales, Apple Card, Apple Music subscriptions and the billions Google pays to be the default search engine on Apple products. We’ll get the final results for Apple’s services performance for 2019 when the company reports earnings on January 28. Apple made an even bigger push into services last year with the launch of several new subscription products, like Apple News+, the Apple Arcade gaming service and the streaming TV service Apple TV+. It’s still too early to judge the success of those subscription services, especially Apple TV+, since it comes free for one year with the purchase of a new Apple gadget. (Even Apple has said Apple TV+ won’t be material to its financials.) But the foundation is in place for Apple to get more out of its subscription services in the coming years as it builds out its content offerings. Finally, Cook gave us a hint during Apple’s last earnings call that the company is noodling around with the idea of an “Apple Prime” subscription bundle that would include everything from yearly iPhone upgrades to streaming services for one monthly fee. Apple may talk about services more than anything else, but the growth in its wearable accessories business has become a much more interesting story. Apple’s wearables business includes devices like the AirPods, AirPods Pro, Apple Watch and Beats headphones. Last year, Apple upgraded the “regular” AirPods with improved battery life and an optional wireless",error,513
1688," used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.” The chip never took off, and encryption thrived. Apple clashed with the Justice Department and then-FBI Director James Comey over encryption in a very similar case in 2016, with one major difference. In that case, the FBI wanted to break into an iPhone used by a mass shooter in San Bernardino, California. The case spilled out into a court battle with specific legal arguments before the FBI said it found a third party that could unlock the device and gave up the court battle, leaving the issue of whether Apple would be compelled to unlock the phones unsettled. So far in the Pensacola case, the Justice Department hasn’t filed for a court order to compel Apple to give it access, and Barr declined to comment in a press conference on Monday whether he would seek a court order. Instead, this conflict is playing out in the press and in tweets. As Ron Gula, a former National Security Agency employee and current security technology investor, said about Barr’s request to unlock the iPhone: “They are making a public appeal of it. They are trying to do it to get political points and change policy, which is their job.” Because it’s not a court battle yet, Apple hasn’t been compelled to say if it’s possible to unlock a customer’s iPhone. But in a filing in the San Bernardino conflict in 2016, an Apple privacy engineer outlined how Apple would start to build software to unlock the iPhone, including assigning a team of six to 10 Apple engineers and other employees to work on the project for up to a month. It also warned that the software it built for the government could become dangerous, and Apple wouldn’t want it to leave its facilities. Apple continues to argue that building a backdoor would create a vulnerability for all of its products — if the FBI had a tool to extract information for legitimate reasons, criminals could use that same tool to extract health or financial data from a lost or stolen iPhone, foreign governments could use that tool to spy on Americans, and so on. Historically, the pro-security technologists have been right: the Clipper Chip was later found to have significant security holes. If the chip had been widely adopted, it would have given hackers several different methods to break into Clipper-equipped devices. That’s why Apple CEO Tim Cook called the government’s 2016 request “the software equivalent of cancer.” He even threatened to resign in",error,513
1703," moving 15% to 30% of production from China to Southeast Asia.  China may not want to risk accelerating this move.  “China is already facing headwinds as companies such as Apple look to diversify their manufacturing base,” Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. “So it could be a double whammy if China targets Apple in China and indirectly Foxconn, it would further accelerate the manufacturing to outside of China.” Meanwhile, Apple has 42 stores in China and multiple partners that distribute its product. On top of that, Apple said last year that it has 2.5 million developers on its platform. Since the App Store launched in China in 2010, developers have earned more than 200 billion yuan ($28.1 billion).  “Apple has huge direct and indirect contribution to the Chinese economy. So Beijing will have to think twice before targeting Apple,” Shah said.  Apple has also forged a good relationship with authorities in Beijing, according to Paul Triolo, head of Eurasia Group’s geotechnology practice.  “We do not think Beijing will go after Apple. There could be some brand boycott efforts, but not major moves against high profile companies like Apple that have very good relationships with local governments and Beijing,” Triolo told CNBC. It’s not the first time Apple has been caught in the middle of a battle between Washington and Huawei. Last year, after Huawei as put on the U.S. Entity List in May, some social media citizens in China rallied behind the company and said they would no longer buy Apple products. But that social media backlash didn’t appear to have a huge effect on the company.  Indeed, Apple has to be very careful how it operates in China, where there is heavy censorship. Authorities often ask companies to comply with removal requests of content that the government does not like. Last year, Apple removed a mapping app from its App Store that was used by anti-government protesters in Hong Kong after Chinese state media ran a piece headlined: “Is Apple helping HK rioters engage in more violence?” The protest movement in Hong Kong is aimed at pushing back against the perceived growing influence of China on the special administrative region.  Apple said at the time that it removed the mapping app because it “has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong” and has been “used to target and ambush police.”",error,513
1712," attend if they had a ticket.  But for the 6,000 people who would have attended an in-person WWDC this year, the remote format eliminates two of the biggest draws for the conference: face time with Apple engineers who built the software and networking with similar-minded people and friends.  Apple said earlier this week that it will upload over 100 videos featuring Apple engineers during WWDC week. A batch of videos will be uploaded each morning at 10am, and can be viewed on the web or in Apple apps. These are a replacement for class-like “sessions” on topics like Apple’s App Store review process or the specific peculiarities of under-the-hood software that were traditionally held at the conference center. “Dub Dub, one of the best things about it is that all the talks are done by the engineers that who made the stuff. They’re not done by marketing or product managers,” Hudson said. “The folks on stage, they’re saying ‘I coded this feature pretty much,’ and you’re getting it straight from the horse’s mouth.” In addition to sessions, Apple holds “labs” which gives attendees the chance to get in-person help from an Apple engineer on a specific topic. This year, to replace the labs, Apple is turning to videoconferencing. Anyone who has a registered Apple developer account will be able to request a lab appointment, and availability is limited, Apple said. Apple will also redesign developer forums on its website to make it easier for people to ask questions of Apple engineers remotely. The new design will launch on June 18. The remote format will also limit the social aspects of the conference. In previous years, attendees have gone to events including morning runs, sushi dinners, and even trips to Costco during WWDC week. Attendees have played games like collecting a full set of free enamel pins that Apple gave out. This year, all of that is cancelled.  Many developers are responding by trying to create community online by creating Slack groups, wrangling developer blogs, and scheduling online Zoom meetups. On Kickstarter, Apple fans have paid over $15,000 for unofficial WWDC enamel pins.  Adrian Eves, an iOS developer based in Alabama, said he plans to take all of WWDC week off work so he can follow along with the videos and announcements. He’s created a Slack group called WWDC Lobby to",error,513
1715,"�s California-based employees can use a health-care system known as AC Wellness. The company doesn’t speak about it much and hasn’t said whether it plans to expand those clinics to consumers more broadly. For now, it likely functions as a way for the health teams to learn about the practice of delivering medicine - and not just building tech.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple teamed up with Google to release contact tracing technology for mobile phones, which public health researchers can use to build apps to track exposure to the virus. The company has seen the most traction for that in Europe and Asia.  Doctors have mixed feelings about the role of consumer health devices, including Apple’s. While some are bullish on their potential, others say that it’s highly cumbersome for them to analyze this patient-generated information, and they don’t currently get paid for the extra work. Many are simply refusing to look at data from wearable devices. When John Koetsier, a technology consultant and writer, tried to share his Apple Watch data with a doctor, he was essentially told to keep it to himself. Koetsier had been tracking his food intake, weight and exercise on his own. But his doctor said that he had too many information sources already, and was feeling overwhelmed.  There are also questions about the accuracy of wearable devices when tracking health data. “I trust Apple’s step tracking, but heart rate I’m more concerned about,” said Dr. Josh Emdur, a telemedicine doctor with SteadyMD. Emdur said he once admitted a patient into the hospital a few years ago because of an Apple Watch result, but it turned out to be a false alarm. He acknowledges that the data seems to have improved since then, and he’s now using Apple Watches as a heart health screening tool. But he’ll still recommend a medical device, like a Zio cardiac monitor, as a followup.  “To make the use- generated data actionable from devices like the Apple Watch, it needs to integrate better with electronic health record dashboard so a care team can see trends and it all comes in in a structured way,” he said. New York-based cardiologist Dr. Jeffrey Wessler says the Apple Watch offers more benefits than harms. “It really was a catalyst for the industry because it was the first time a consumer device began to infiltrate the clinical environment",error,513
1715," in a high volume way,” said Wessler, who runs preventative heart health clinics called Heartbeat. ” But he notes that it can be frustrating patients come in with a concerning Apple Watch reading but no risk factors. In that case, there might not be a clear treatment pathway, and they’re simply sent back home and told to come in if they develop symptoms. “That’s taking visits and time away from people who really need us,” said Wessler.  Apple could make money in health by using it as a way to market and sell more of its devices. But there are much bigger opportunities in the $3.5 trillion health care sector. The company has already announced partnerships with insurers, like Aetna, where users can “earn off” the cost of a device by engaging in healthy behaviors. It’s also talking to some private Medicare plans about subsidizing the cost of the device for seniors. Imagine if the company could somehow build a body of clinical evidence to get into the business of taking on risk for a population. If it can truly prove that it could improve the quality of care and bring down costs, that would be a huge opportunity. That vision would take many years to achieve, but it would certainly meet Cook’s goal of having a major impact on health care. Another game-changer would be if Apple can introduce more sophisticated sensors, including non-invasive glucose or blood sugar monitoring or a blood-pressure monitor. At that point, its device could reach a much bigger market -- 6 in 10 Americans - with one or more chronic diseases, as well as prevention.  More than 1 in 3 Americans, for instance, are at high risk for type 2 diabetes.  “If they came out with a blood sugar or blood pressure monitor that was non-invasive and continuous, it would be a complete game changer,” said Berggren. “That’s what we dream about for the watch.” “I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Apple still in the space,” said Bajarin. “For me, it’s really hinges on preventative health (as) that really expands the potential of the Apple Watch.” Other experts suggested the following areas where Apple should go next: Better sleep tracking: “I’d love to see more in that direction,” said Dr. Calvin Wu",error,513

Struggles are anticipated at Google and Facebook, with advertisers in travel, hospitality and retail pulling back on spending. Alphabet is expected to report a drop in revenue for the second quarter and a slight increase in the third quarter, while Facebook’s revenue growth in the second quarter is expected to sink into the single digits for the first time since the company’s IPO in 2012 and remain there in the third quarter. Facebook could also lose about $100 million in third-quarter revenue from ad boycotts tied to the “Stop Hate for Profit” campaign, according to Wedbush Securities. But Wedbush’s Michael Pachter still recommends buying Facebook shares, in part because the company has untapped money-making opportunities from Instagram and WhatsApp. “Notwithstanding well-publicized boycotts of Facebook’s platform by many major brands beginning in early July, Facebook has consistently executed on its core business model and we expect the company to capture market share in a declining advertising spend environment, given its scale and robust suite of targeting and measurement tools to help advertisers manage costs and maximize budget efficiency,” Pachter said in a report on Monday. Amazon has been the best-performing stock among the mega-cap tech companies this year, up 63%. That’s despite CEO Jeff Bezos’ suggestion at the end of April that, “If you’re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat.” Bezos said at the time that the company would invest its expected $4 billion second-quarter profit in coronavirus-related efforts, including buying personal protective equipment for workers and building its own testing capability. But Bezos’ warning couldn’t turn investors off of Amazon’s perpetual expansion, which has continued thanks to surging demand for delivery of groceries and household products, combined with growth in Amazon’s cloud infrastructure and streaming content units. Bezos and his Big Tech CEO counterparts have more to contend with this week than just updating investors. On Wednesday — a day before addressing investors — Bezos will make his first appearance before Congress, joining the leaders of Apple, Facebook and Alphabet in trying to convince lawmakers that competition remains plentiful.  In his opening statement to the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, Bezos will remind representatives that Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and will name Target, Costco and Walmart as competitors, according to",error,513
1739," CNBC that AWS provides services to customers across the political spectrum, and confirmed that the suspension took place over content that the company says clearly encouraged violence. “We respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow,” said an AWS spokesperson. “However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service.”  They added: “We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.”  Apple removed Parler from the iPhone App Store on Saturday. The company said that posts on Parler related to the U.S. Capitol riot last week included calls for violence, which violates Apple’s rules against objectionable content. “We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,” an Apple representative said in a statement. “Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.” Google removed Parler from its Android app store, Google Play, on Friday. “In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence,” said a Google spokesperson. “All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“The news follows Twitter’s permanent suspension of Trump’s Twitter account, which had 88 million followers, over what it said was the president",error,513
1747," that with active noise cancellation, similar to what you’d find in Apple’s AirPods Pro. It’s subtle but I noticed it did a good job blocking out wind during a run, most of the roar of a lawnmower across the street while I was in my office, and the hum of my exercise bike. Higher pitched noises, like my one-year-old’s laughter, still snuck in. I think Apple’s noise cancellation is still a hair stronger, but the important thing is this is much better than the first model. Like AirPods, there’s a passthrough mode that can boost outside noise, which was useful when I was walking with a stroller and still wanted to hear cars and my surroundings. Amazon also improved the case you stow them in. It’s 40% smaller and includes more modern USB-C charging, which means you can use the same cable that charges an Android phone. A case with wireless charging is available for $20 more. Amazon partnered with Anker on a new wireless charging pad that you might want to consider. It’s $18, works well, and has a nifty little groove you can stand the Echo Buds in so you know they’re in the right spot and charging every time. I like having Alexa built-in. You can bring up the voice assistant at any time by saying “Hey Alexa” to play music across a variety of apps, including popular ones like Spotify, Pandora, Amazon Music and others. Or you can ask Alexa to do stuff like turn off the lights in your office. You can still use Google Assistant if you’re on Android, or Siri on an iPhone, by changing the long-press touch control on the side of the Echo Buds. Sometimes these controls were finicky for me, though. There seems to be a slight delay, so sometimes it paused a song when I double tapped instead of skipping it. Battery life is also solid. Amazon promises five hours of music with active noise canceling on, or four hours of call time. The case, which recharges the Echo Buds, lasts 19.5 hours before you have to recharge it by plugging it into the wall or (if you have the wireless option) setting it on the charging pad. That lined up with my experience. I charged it fully on Saturday and, as of Wednesday, I have 23% left in the case and 88% left in",error,513
1752," CNBC earlier Friday. Schiff in a statement applauded the move as “an important first step.” But the watchdog’s investigation “will not obviate the need for other forms of oversight and accountability – including public oversight by Congress – and the Department must cooperate in that effort as well,” Schiff said. Monaco, the No. 2 official in the Justice Department, was confirmed by the Senate in April. Horowitz has served as inspector general since 2012. Horowitz’s statement Friday said his probe “will examine the Department’s compliance with applicable DOJ policies and procedures, and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations. “If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider other issues that may arise during the review,” he said, adding, “The review will not substitute the OIG’s judgment for the legal and investigative judgments made in the matters under OIG review.” The Times’ article came weeks after reports that the Trump administration had secretly obtained records from journalists at multiple news outlets. Schiff on Thursday night demanded an investigation into the Trump DOJ’s actions on “this and other cases that suggest the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president.” Trump “tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media,” Schiff said in a statement. “It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears.” Swalwell in his own statement said Apple informed him last month that his records had been turned over to the Trump administration “as part of a politically motivated investigation into his perceived enemies.” “Like many of the world’s most despicable dictators, former President Trump showed an utter disdain for our democracy and the rule of law,” Swalwell said. “This kind of conduct is unacceptable, but unfortunately on brand for a president who has repeatedly shown he would cast aside our Constitution for his own personal gain.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., added Friday that Congress must seek testimony from Sessions and Barr. “The revelation that the Trump Justice Department secretly subpoenaed metadata of House Intelligence Committee Members and staff and their families, including a minor, is shocking,” Schumer and Durbin said in a joint statement Friday. “This is a gross abuse of power and",error,513
1777," each existing iPhone user. The company will no longer disclose iPhone unit sales, and will instead focus on convincing customers to pony up for services like iCloud storage or Apple Music. Cook also told CNBC on Tuesday that the company will launch new services this year. (That will likely include a streaming video service based on the company’s growing library of original programming and a news subscription offering through Apple News.) But Apple’s install base can only get it so far. Though the company says it has over 1 billion devices installed, many owners own multiple devices, and one subscription to an Apple service like Music or iCloud can be used on multiple gadgets at once. So Apple needs help. Amazon’s Alexa can now control Apple Music, and Samsung has convinced Apple to write an iTunes TV app based on Samsung’s Tizen operating system. Those new Sony TVs run on Android, meaning you’ll be able to use Siri to control Google software. This is just the beginning. It’s not a stretch to imagine the partnerships announced over the last month will extend to other platforms too, like Google Home speakers, Roku boxes and Amazon’s FireTV. It’s a strategy that requires Apple to sacrifice some level of control. Think back to Netflix. Years ago, as the company was making its transition from DVDs to streaming video, it considered making its own streaming set-top box for TVs. It eventually scrapped those plans after realizing the best way to get Netflix to everyone was to make its service available on everything. The decision paid off. It’s nearly impossible to find a device that doesn’t support the Netflix app, and the strategy has helped it grow to nearly 140 million subscribers around the world and a $147 billion market cap. That has to be the opportunity Apple is looking at as it brings apps like iTunes to rival devices. It’s not unfamiliar. In 2003, Apple launched iTunes on Windows, helping it grow into the top digital music store in the world. At the time Apple wanted to sell more iPods and, for that to happen, iTunes needed to be available on the dominant operating system. Apple also launched Apple Music on Android a few years ago, but results are unclear. Apple Music has at least 50 million subscribers, and most of them are likely iPhone users since Apple music comes loaded on every device. Things are different today. While there’s plenty of opportunity for Apple to continue growing its services revenue through the current hardware install base, it’s",error,513
1781," AI research. The company said in its statement Wednesday: “We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever.”  But as far as products go, competition in self-driving and electric vehicles has grown dramatically in the last four years.  Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car company, recently opened up its self-driving car service to the public in Phoenix, Ariz., and is widely considered to be the leaders in self driving. Legacy car companies like GM working on self-driving technology. And it’s not just Tesla making electric cars. Porsche, Audi, Mercedes and other legacy car companies have all announced electric vehicles. It’s hard to imagine how Apple would stand out. “The sense that I had is they’re not as far along as I had hoped,” Munster said of Apple’s decision to remove the 200 employees out of its car division. “But they still have initiative there.” Giannandrea’s rapid rise at Apple is the biggest signal yet that Apple intends to invest a lot of time, money and talent in improving AI. Plus, according to leaked comments from Cook at a recent company all-hands meeting reported by Bloomberg, Apple plans to continue hiring in AI “at a strong pace” even as it slows down hiring in other divisions. In short, we’re seeing Apple eliminate jobs in self-driving and increase the number of people working more broadly on AI. It may already be paying off. Late last year, a study from Munster’s company, Loup Ventures, showed Siri vastly improved its ability to correctly answer a series of 800 questions. The Loup study said Siri answered 74.6 percent of the questions correctly, up 22 percentage points from just nine months earlier. By comparison, Google Assistant answered 87.9 percent of the questions correctly. Alexa got 72.5 percent of the questions right. It’s not just about getting questions right, though. The messier problem for Apple is training its AI while convincing users that it’s keeping their data secure.  Google trains its AI systems in part using the massive amounts of public data available on YouTube and the Google search engine. (It’s also started using a program that strives to protect users’ data.)   But Apple has taken a hard stance against unf",error,513

That said, buy-side expectations deteriorated meaningfully in the four weeks post Apple’s pre-announcement such that even our lowered estimates are better than feared (bears expect FY19e EPS of $11)... Importantly, Apple made investors feel better about several recent debates - 1) weaker iPhone demand, 2) gross margin risk, and 3) Services growth deceleration, which we address below in more detail... We continue to value Apple on a SoTP basis which drives our $197 PT, down from $211 previously on our lower revenue estimates offset partially by higher peer multiples...” “This quarter was clearly about investors putting bookends around downside risks to Apple’s iPhone unit volume outlook and the F2Q19 revenue guidance of $55-$59 bn managed to reassure investors that volume risks are largely priced in the shares at current valuation... As we had previewed in our Jan 28 report, buy-side expectations going into the announcement were low and below sell-side revenue consensus of $59 bn, which in part should drive a positive reaction to the F2Q19 revenue guide today... Beyond the F2Q19 guidance, which we believe implies 20%+ y/y decline in iPhone shipments, investors will look for improvement in y/y volume trends (although still declining) in the remainder of the year, leading to low double-digit percentage volume declines for the year... Outside of the focus on iPhone volumes, there were other silver linings in the report relative to new disclosures on the Services segment, including gross margin of 62.8% in F1Q19, which we believe was at the high-end of investor estimates going into the announcement... Additionally, Services gross margin improvement of +450 bps y/y and +170 bps q/q in F1Q19 is likely to increase investor confidence in long-term expansion of gross-margins with increasing scale of various services opportunities.

More broadly speaking, last night’s earnings call reaffirmed our concern that several structural headwinds exist to iPhone’s business, including (1) elongating replacement cycles; (2) natural limits to pricing; and (3) a strategically challenged position within the China market...

We believe iPhone inventory levels exiting FQ1 are within the company’s normal range and the implied deterioration in iPhone revenue is likely a reﬂection of uncertainty in demand. Apple’s newly disclosed Services gross margin at ~63% fell short of our expectations due to higher than expected cost allocations associated with recent revenue restatements.

After five transformative years leading the company’s retail and online stores, Angela Ahrendts plans to depart Apple in April for new personal and professional pursuits. In her expanded role, Deirdre will bring her three decades of Apple experience to lead the company’s global retail reach, focused on the connection between the customer and the people and processes that serve them. She will continue to lead the People team, overseeing all People-related functions, including talent development and Apple University, recruiting, employee relations and experience, business partnership, benefits, compensation, and inclusion and diversity. “At Apple, we believe our soul is our people, and Deirdre understands the qualities and strengths of our team better than anyone,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “For more than three decades, she has helped keep Apple focused on serving customers and enriching lives. She’s an exceptional leader and she’s been a vital partner to our retail teams around the world since the very beginning. I am thrilled to work alongside Deirdre in her new role, and I know our 70,000 retail employees will be, too.” “People come to Apple to do the best work of their lives, and our retail teams show their passion every day, in every interaction, all around the world,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of Retail + People. “It is the opportunity of a lifetime to work with, and learn from, such a talented, diverse and imaginative team.

1798,", Siri, back in 2011, but compared with competitors like Google and Amazon, the company’s artificial intelligence efforts have fallen behind. Siri has often been criticized for failing to answer questions that Google and Amazon’s assistant, Alexa, can answer. (Although a recent study by Loup Ventures has shown that Siri has improved quite a bit in recent months.) Apple gave its biggest signal that it’s going to heavily invest in improving AI  when it poached Google’s head of AI John Giannandrea away from the company last year. Within a few months, Apple reorganized its AI and machine learning divisions under Giannandrea, and it most recently promoted him to its executive team. In addition to the reorganization around Giannandrea, Apple’s longtime head of Siri, Bill Stasior, has left the company, The Information reported. Tying into Apple’s AI plans is the smart home, where household appliances are controlled via voice or a smartphone app. Apple is largely viewed as falling behind Amazon and Google in the smart home space. However, it recently hired Sam Jadallah, former CEO of smart lock company Otto, to run the division, CNBC reported Saturday. The gateway to the smart home, voice-controlled smart speakers, is dominated by Amazon and Google. Amazon’s Echo has 70 percent of the smart-speaker market in the U.S., and Google has 24 percent, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Apple’s HomePod speaker, which launched early last year, only as 6 percent of the market, according to the study. Apple’s smart-home ambitions largely live within iOS, which ships with a Home app that lets you control hundreds of third-party connected gadgets like light switches, cameras and door locks. But the ubiquity of Google and Amazon’s speakers has given those two companies a huge head start in the smart home. Apple’s self-driving car project, Project Titan, is one of the biggest open secrets in the tech industry. Although the company has yet to release a product related to self-driving cars, Cook said in a Bloomberg interview in 2017 that it’s the “mother of all AI projects.” However, plenty of other rivals are far ahead of Apple in self-driving technology, most notably Waymo, the Alphabet company that spun out of Google’s self-driving car project. Waymo has been working on self-driving",error,513
1798," cars for the better part of a decade and is already testing an automated ride-hailing service in Phoenix. Last week, new data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles showed Apple’s self-driving cars ranked the worst in disengagements, or instances when a human driver needs to take over from the automated system. And last month, Apple removed 200 employees from its self-driving car division, CNBC reported. Some of those employees were reassigned to Apple’s AI division. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that former Tesla engineering boss Doug Field, who manages Project Titan, decided to make the cuts. The move signaled that Apple could be looking to focus more broadly on AI, not just through projects like self-driving cars. Earlier this month, Apple head of retail Angela Ahrendts announced plans to leave the company in April after five years in the role. Ahrendts was one of Cook’s biggest hires, and she has spent her time at the company transforming Apple’s retail locations into hubs for hanging out and taking classes related to Apple products, not just selling and repairing stuff for customers. Cook appointed Deirdre O’Brien, a 30-year Apple veteran and head of the company’s human resources, to run the company’s retail operations on top of her HR role. It’s the biggest shakeup at the top of Apple’s executive ranks in years. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple’s retail locations could also act as a showcase for Apple’s video subscription offerings by placing TVs in stores that will display clips from its original programming. The Apple Watch, with its heart and activity monitoring, is at the center of the company’s digital health strategy, but its ambitions go beyond that. In a recent interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Cook signaled that health will be a key driver of the company’s growth in the years to come. “We are taking what has been with the institution and empowering the individual to manage their health. And we’re just at the front end of this,” he said. “But I do think, looking back, in the future, you will answer that question: Apple’s most important contribution to mankind has been in health.” The latest Apple Watch can perform an EKG reading that can identify potential heart problems.

Other cards, like the Citi Double Cash card, also offer 2 percent cash back on all purchases while U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite card rewards mobile spending with 3 percent cash back and pays back 4.5 percent on travel. Even if it’s not the best rewards card, it could help build Apple Pay, said CB Insights’ Max Abramsky. “Although Apple is late to the credit card game, its marketing clout and loyal customer base gives the company an opportunity to scale up quickly,” Abramsky said. The Apple Cash rewards will encourage users to keep an account balance and ultimately spend it on online, for in-store purchases or by making peer-to-peer payments. For Goldman, the move marks a further push into its new consumer financial products. Goldman Sachs rolled out its retail bank called Marcus in 2016. Until then, the investment bank was mostly known for catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors throughout its 150-year history. The Apple Card is likely to put more competitive pressure on branded credit card issuers than on Goldman’s fellow banks. But it is also likely a threat to fintech companies, especially if it goes after consumer deposits. “It is conceivable that Apple continues to offer more financial products to its customer base, particularly bank accounts which is quite complementary to credit accounts,” said Kyle Lui, partner at venture capital firm DCM. “That would be much more competitive to fintech unicorns like SoFi, Chime and even Robinhood.” Fintech companies like Chime, Robinhood, Wealthfront and SoFi have been moving toward holding customer cash by launching cash accounts. Many of them tend to partner with smaller, regional banks instead of big institutions like Goldman and J.P. Morgan.

1814," they are only distributed through the App Store in case users delete them. “As the platform owner, Apple has a couple of advantages,” one developer, who asked to remain anonymous because they feared retribution from Apple, told CNBC. “But it is frustrating from the point of view that [Apple] knows it works better to get more paying customers, and they won’t let us do it.”  Apple says that humans review every submission to the App Store before users can download apps. “What users want from us and what we’ve always provided them is a curated platform,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year in an interview with Vice. “We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.” But some developers complain that Apple’s approach has led to inconsistent policing, given that the App Store has over 2 million different apps on it from a variety of companies, ranging from small start-ups to tech giants like Google and Facebook. Apple has to also fight scam apps, like a recent and ongoing rash of “sneaky subscription” apps that try to fool users into accidentally signing up for expensive monthly subscriptions, which is the reason for many of Apple’s App Store billing guidelines. The App Store review policy has led to some developers treating recommended best practices as actual guidelines. One complaint with the Apple News+ signup screen is that Apple did not put the $9.99 price on the signup button, as many developers believe is required because Apple has slowed down the approval of some apps because subscription pricing isn’t clear. But Apple doesn’t actually require apps to put the subscription price on its button, according to a person familiar with the App Store guidelines. The price just needs to be clearly visible and comply with California laws about automatic renewals. (Apple publishes a 4,000-word guide to how to design for auto-renewing subscriptions that says that “the amount that will be billed must be the most prominent pricing element in the layout.”) Lots of companies send push notifications advertising products and services, despite the fact that the practice is discouraged in Apple’s own guidelines. But promotional push notifications are permitted, the person familiar with the guidelines said, and if developers are thoughtful about what they push, they can send marketing push notifications. Apple is pitching itself to investors and customers as not only a hardware maker and platform owner, but also a company that sells a",error,513
1814," variety of services to its users. Last week, Apple held a launch event at its headquarters in California to underscore the shift and announce new subscription services, including Apple News+ and a new a streaming video package called Apple TV+. Apple CEO Tim Cook has implied he wants the company’s services business to generate $50 billion in revenue by 2020. Apple’s services include fees collected from the App Store, subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, gadget warranties from AppleCare and licensing fees from Google to be the Safari web browser’s default search engine. But at the same time, several groups have started to accuse Apple of abusing its power over the App Store to favor its own services over third-party apps. “Apple, you’ve got to break it apart from their App Store. It’s got to be one or the other,” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an interview with The Verge. “Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don’t get to do both at the same time.” Spotify recently submitted an antitrust complaint against Apple to the European Commission. “In recent years, Apple has introduced rules to the App Store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience — essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in a letter. Apple posted a response to Spotify on its website that said that Spotify was trying to use Apple’s platform without paying the cost. However, whether Apple’s control over the App Store is anticompetitive is a tricky question, antitrust experts said. One reason is that consumers who want an alternative can easily buy an Android phone, meaning that Apple may not be technically dominant. “Apple doesn’t have the same broad monopoly power that Google and Facebook have,” Open Markets legal director Sandeep Vaheesan said. “Antitrust challenges arise when Apple tries to restrict other entities on its platform,” he continued. “It’s a real concern because Apple has told both iOS users and developers if you want to sell or purchase you have to go through the App Store, and there’s no other way for the two sides to connect with each other.” Another fact that could stymie Spotify and Warren’s arguments is that Apple has legitimate product reasons to control access to the App Store, including security and its",error,513
1822,"inatory (FRAND) licensing. But technology companies and governments often have different ideas about what constitutes fair and reasonable. Apple’s main objection was that Qualcomm forced it to license these patents even though it was already a big customer for Qualcomm’s chips. “The issue that we have with Qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license, no chips. This is, in our view, illegal,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in January. Apple also objected to Qualcomm’s pricing scheme, where it used the total sales price of an entire device to figure out what to charge, instead of the sales price of a modem chip. Eventually, the two companies settled on a royalty price of $7.50 per device, which Apple still thought was too high. As Cook put it: “They have an obligation to offer their patent portfolio on a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis and they don’t do that. They charge exorbitant prices.” Apple isn’t the only party that’s had problems with Qualcomm’s business practices. In 2009, South Korea’s antitrust agency, protecting local companies like Samsung and LG, fined Qualcomm $200 million for abusing its market position in radio frequency chips, saying in a statement more recently that a “monopolist enterprise’s abuse of its market position cannot be tolerated.” The KFTC later fined Qualcomm again in 2016 for $854 million for what it said were unfair business practices. In 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China to resolve another complicated antitrust dispute. As part of that agreement, Qualcomm was required to lower its royalty rates in China for handset makers like Xiaomi and Huawei. Perhaps the biggest threat to Qualcomm is a battle with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which ended in a trial earlier this year. The verdict has not yet been released. On Tuesday, Apple put all these objections aside and bought the patent license it was fighting for six years as part of the settlement. Shortly after the deal between Apple and Qualcomm was announced, Intel said it would exit the 5G chip market, leaving Apple with one fewer option it could buy the part from. After the announcement, Nikkei and Bloomberg both reported that Apple had long been concerned that Intel could not meet demand for the parts. The uncomfortable truth for Apple: Qualcomm is still the leader in wireless technology, and with next-generation 5G networks currently being built, Apple had little",error,513
1828," talked about. By announcing three new online subscription services and a co-branded credit card with Goldman Sachs, Apple underscored just how many new revenue streams it could launch. Only one of the products, Apple News+, was available for consumers after the event. Forte called the event “strange” but said that it helped investors start to “think about life after iPhone.” “Investors have bought hook-line-and-sinker into the notion that services revenue is going to be a fast growing number for Apple,” he said. “In our view, investors still don’t fully appreciate the strength of Apple’s platform with iOS users more engaged with mobile services and spending 10x Android users on mobile apps,” Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty wrote in an April note, pointing out that Apple has doubled the number of paid online services this year. It’s possible that Apple will provide some details to investors and analysts on Tuesday about how well Apple News+ is performing, even if it doesn’t show up on Apple’s balance sheet, as well as other data points to underscore that its services business is growing quickly. The only data point on the $10 per month service so far is that 200,000 people signed up in the first 48 hours it was available. A year ago, Apple reported $9.19 billion in services revenue, which includes subscriptions, fees from its App Store distribution platform, AppleCare warranties, and money from an agreement with Google to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone’s browser. Analysts and investors are also looking to see if Apple says how much it plans to spend on capital return. It’s that time of year. Last April, Apple announced that it would spend $100 billion on dividends and buybacks over the next year, partially driven by tax reform passed in December 2017. It also said that it wanted to become “net cash neutral over time,” which means that it intends to spend all of the cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. Forte says that Apple’s capital return announcement “derisks” the quarter in case of a miss. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to announce a 10% dividend raise and at least a $50 billion increase into the authorized buyback fund. “We continue to forecast Apple repurchasing $15-20 billion in shares each quarter through fiscal 2021, which will reduce total diluted shares outstanding by",error,513

Last quarter, only 53% of Apple’s total $58.01 billion in revenue came from the iPhone. That’s because of Apple’s growing services business, including App Store fees and online subscriptions, which made up 19% of Apple’s revenue in the second-quarter, a record for the company. Analysts will be closely watching the services business for strong growth — Huberty expects Apple will post services revenue 20% higher than a year ago, but the Street is looking for 15%. “The combination of negative investor sentiment, the potential for a Services acceleration in June, and a low bar for September guidance keep us positively biased into earnings,” Huberty said in a July 22 note. Many investors have hope that a 5G iPhone might spur a big wave of upgrades. Apple doesn’t talk about future products, but it did just buy Intel’s modem division for $1 billion, which included a lot of 5G-related intellectual property and employees who know how to work on 5G technologies. That deal will close later this year, but investors will be watching for 5G timing hints from the company’s leadership. “We expect the narrative to shift more towards new services launch in 2H and to a 5G story heading into 2020,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note Wednesday. Also expect analysts to ask Apple CEO Tim Cook about head designer Jony Ive, a longtime Apple veteran who reported directly to Cook and headed the company’s industrial design as well as interface design. The company’s announcement of his departure in June didn’t hit the stock much, but he was instrumental in many of Apple’s most important products and many outsiders saw him as the guiding force behind its product philosophy. Apple might also have to address its relationship with the Trump administration and its trade war with China. Apple assembles its products in China, which is also the company’s third-largest market behind the Americas and Europe. Last week, Trump said that he would not give Apple a waiver for Mac Pro parts imported from China, and then later said he had a “lot of liking for” Cook and that he expected Apple to announce a factory in Texas. Apple didn’t respond",error,513
1834," low bar for September guidance keep us positively biased into earnings. But we believe there is also a clear catalyst path beyond earnings that will help the stock re-rate towards our updated $247 price target over the next 6-9 months, making it a top pick for 2H19.” “We believe that consumer and market datapoints suggest in line to slightly weak iPhone sales in FQ3 to June and Services revenue growth in line with our forecast but below consensus. For the guide we believe Apple could upside unit expectations slightly given the earlier launch of all new models in September but we see some risk to ASP expectations given the lower priced XIR launch in September vs. late October in 2018. We continue to believe consensus expectations are high for FQ1 to December with our unit forecast 5% below FactSet consensus. We also do not see various new Services offerings driving enough additional earnings to make a material difference to Apple’s slowing growth profile.” “In our opinion, investors expect fundamentals to be relatively weak heading into AAPL’s F3Q19 earnings despite the recent move in the stock. Our Apple indicator projects improving trends that could drive some upside to our estimates... We maintain our Buy on stabilization in iPhones, strong capital return program, services growth, and future new products.” “We are heading into Apple’s earnings report with a higher level of investor interest relative to recent history given the confluence of softer macro but also low bar of expectations. The level of interest has recently peaked given the backdrop of a softer growth outlook and with the Bears expecting continuing trade concerns to drive a softer earnings report and outlook, while the Bulls are encouraged by the likelihood of upside surprises driven by iPhone shipments bucking the softer macro through momentum of pricing actions/ promotions.” “Our conversations with investors suggest low expectations for the Q and Fall iPhone builds. UBS Evidence Lab data meanwhile supports general malaise in sentiment with only 19% “bullish” (down from 30% in April) and China demand/tariffs and services growth are predictably the top investor issues.” “Historically, Apple’s fiscal Q3 results have meant relatively little to investors, whose focus by this time had typically shifted to next year’s iPhone cycle – with anticipation driving seasonal outperformance in the stock. Following Apple’s volatile 2019, however, we’d argue that Q3 results will likely matter more than usual, as they could shed",error,513
1840," by 18%. Services margins were over 64%, contributing to Apple’s bottom line. The total services sales were an all-time record, Cook said on a conference call with analysts. “Our strong services performance was broad-based,” Cook said in a call with analysts. “We set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services, and our App Store business, and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the App Store.” If you add the wearables and services product categories together, they are together approaching the size of a Fortune 50 company, Cook said, underscoring that Apple’s non-iPhone product lines are still massive, even if they are not as big as the iPhone. The installed base of iPhones hit an all-time high, Apple said, although it did not provide an updated number. In January, Apple said that there were 900 million iPhones in use. Apple also outperformed expectations in China, which had been one of the main factors in disappointing quarters earlier this year. Cook said in an interview with CNBC that a Chinese VAT tax cut had been a big help, and that he saw no signs of a nationalistic boycott of Apple products in China. “The VAT reduced from 16% to 13%, that’s clearly a big help. We took some price action, that’s a big help. We introduced trade-in and financing, that’s a big help. The more subjective thing is, when the countries are meeting and talking, that’s better than not,” Cook told CNBC. Apple said that it had $9.61 billion in sales in its Greater China category, which also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the previous quarter, Apple’s Greater China sales declined 22%, China sales were only down 4%. Cook said that Apple returned to growth in mainland China. Apple bought Intel’s modem division earlier this month for $1 billion, an unusually large buy for the company. “This is our second largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff,” Cook said. Modems are semiconductor components used to connect to cellular networks like those run by Verizon and AT&T. Earlier this year, Apple settled a long-standing legal dispute with Qualcomm and signed a deal to buy smartphone components, including modems, from Qualcomm for several years; Apple had previously been working with Intel to try and replace Qualcomm as a supplier. Cook explained the purchase was",error,513

Hypothetically, in a public situation, “Apple will take the hit for it even though the battery came from an unknown source.” In the last year, Apple introduced a feature in the iPhone settings app that warns users that the device can’t verify that it’s an “genuine Apple battery” and removes other battery health statistics such as its maximum capacity. Maluf expects other device companies to follow. Apple has also fought counterfeit batteries in the legal system and on online retailers, but it does not sell authentic batteries directly to users. Apple recommends that users lean on its network of authorized repair shops to get any battery replacement work done. Apple said that in addition to its network of stores, there are 1,800 authorized dealers in the United States that have access to authentic Apple parts and batteries. Owners of the recalled MacBook Pro laptops can bring them into Apple or certain authorized service centers for a free repair, Apple said on its website. Even if a very small percentage of batteries end up having problems, that can still translate to a surprisingly large number. Apple’s recall affected 432,000 laptops sold in the United States. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Apple received 26 reports of the battery overheating, or roughly six out of every 100,000 laptops. But it only takes one video of a smoking laptop to go viral — as happened in late May. DJ White Panda said on Reddit that his Apple laptop “exploded and burst into flames” in a post that got over 5,000 upvotes and was widely shared. Tweet And the number of laptops sold pales in comparison to the number of phones out there — in Apple’s fiscal 2018, the last year for which figures are available, Apple sold over 217 million iPhones, each with an embedded lithium-ion battery, and that’s not even counting sales from Samsung and Huawei, which ship more phones. As products like smartwatches and wireless headphones become more common, the number of lithium-ion batteries in the wild will expand even more. It’s a real concern on flights. After all, nearly everyone on a flight has a smartphone, and a good number of people also are carrying laptops, battery packs, and other gadgets. A fire has never spread on a flight due to a faulty battery, but batteries cause flight disruptions",error,513
1862," Watch team to explore sensors and algorithms in health care in 2016, after it became clear that fashion wasn’t moving the needle for users. This year, an employee morale survey in the health team showed signs of discontent, two people said. After the survey, Williams personally spoke with several employees to figure out the source of the problem and expressed that he remains deeply committed to the health group. As the COO, however, he has many other duties, including overseeing Apple’s operations and supply chain. The health group’s leadership includes Kevin Lynch, who oversees software projects, including the group of doctors and engineers working on health records; Eugene Kim, who leads watch hardware, and Sumbul Desai, who oversees the clinical team that runs AC Wellness health clinics, the electrocardiogram app and the Apple Heart Study, and health strategy. There’s also a separate business development group under former health consultant Myoung Cha that works with health insurance customers, such as Aetna, as well as pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson. Desai, Lynch and Kim all report to Williams. Cha has a different chain of command and reports to Douglas Beck, a vice president of Americas and Northeast Asia. These four leaders manage hundreds of people working within Apple Health, which has been aggressively hiring and expanding in recent years. At present, there’s no single senior vice president dedicated to health. Most of the Apple Health employees who left the company worked in Desai’s group, or left shortly after she was recruited in the summer of 2017 from Stanford University, where she was running many of its digital health efforts. Desai is a doctor and was brought on to run clinical efforts, including Apple’s health clinics, in the summer of 2017. She then expanded her scope to other areas, including the Apple Heart Study and the electrocardiogram app and sensor, one of the people said. Now, former hospital COO M. Osman Akhtar is running day-to-day operations for the clinics, two people said. One of the key issues is long-term vision inside Apple’s health team. Four people told CNBC that some employees feel the company could be taking on more ambitious projects and doing more in health. Instead, its products and services are mostly confined to wellness and prevention. The people noted these differences of opinion have flared up between the different groups. Wellness involves helping those who are generally healthy with areas including exercise, meditation and sleep",error,513
1862,", while medical applications target patients with specific diseases. Wellness is less risky and less regulated than diagnosing and treating disease, but it’s not where most of the cost is in the health-care system. Almost 90% of U.S. health-care expenditures are for people with chronic diseases, according to the CDC. One faction wanted to introduce a telemedicine service and move into health payments to simplify insurance billing, but it was not successful in driving these initiatives ahead. Others wanted to do more with Beddit, a sleep sensor that a team at Apple spent months vetting before it was acquired in mid-2017. There are also disagreements over the AC Wellness health clinics and whether they should expand into medical software and eventually produce products for clinicians or remain focused on Apple employees. A small product team led by Apple veteran Jason Fass left AC Wellness in 2017. AC Wellness is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple, but Apple employees work there and it advertises jobs on Apple’s website. There was also tension about how much the health team should borrow from the Apple playbook. When the company announced its electrocardiogram for the Apple Watch in the fall of 2018, some doctors and others in the medical industry outside of Apple reacted negatively to the news. This frustrated some people internally who had argued for a small and focused product launch, which involved the medical community getting to weigh in and ask questions to reduce any potential pushback. The company compromised by secretly convening groups of medical experts, including cardiologists, at its headquarters every six months or so, and by introducing content developed with the support of doctors at Apple specifically for doctors. Two of the people said there were also disagreements about how transparent the company should be about its work to the medical industry. Apple has previously remained highly secretive about its projects. Yet that level of secrecy is more challenging to maintain in health care because the industry typically runs on published research, clinical studies and keeping an open dialogue with stakeholders in the industry. Other high-level departures from the group over the past few years are Robin Goldstein, who was at Apple for more than two decades and most recently worked on the regulatory side of health before leaving in late 2017; Anil Sethi, a former Apple Health director who left to form a health-tech start-up in late 2017; Stephen Friend, a top Apple researcher who departed at the end of 2017; Charles Schlaff, who worked on Apple Watch before moving over to special projects and left in November 2018, according to",error,513
1869," headphones — where Apple sounded most enthusiastic on its recent earnings call. Cook called it a “blowout quarter” for wearables and said there was “phenomenal demand” for the $159 AirPods. For more on iconic global companies and executives embracing change and transforming for the future, join us live at CNBC Evolve, a summit for business decision makers seeking to innovate. Services revenue, which includes subscriptions, App Store fees and other online services, grew by 13%, which was slightly under analyst expectations, though Cook told CNBC that payments from a lawsuit and foreign-exchange rates hit a services category that otherwise would have grown by 18%. The total services sales were an all-time record. “We set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our App Store business, and we achieved a new third-quarter revenue record for the App Store,” Cook said in the recent earnings call with analysts. Wedbush’s Ives said the key number for Apple is not any single-quarter revenue, profit margin or net income. It is the 1.4 billion active devices installed worldwide, a presence on the consumer landscape that is “etched in stone for decades to come if they did nothing more.” The conundrum has been trying to broaden out the product portfolio into other facets of the consumer lifestyle, Ives said: streaming, wearables, payments, credit cards and health. The lines have blurred. Apple’s success as a consumer company is because of the technology it has created and its Silicon Valley DNA. “It wouldn’t have 900 million active iPhones today without patents,” Ives said. “Ultimately, the biggest challenge is breaking into the enterprise and non-consumer areas, and that has historically been a bigger challenge, as MSFT owns enterprise,” Ives said. What defines and should continue to drive Apple is consumer needs and how to monetize its user ecosystem. Its recent product pushes have included hits and misses. While the AirPods have been a hit, Apple’s entry into the smart home device market, Apple HomePod, was “late to the game and mispriced,” Ives said. He said Apple’s success and huge installed base of users can be a double-edged sword, as it allows the company to ignore the first-to-market mantra in developing new products, which may become a riskier strategy in today’s world",error,513
1869,". Amazon has been moving in the opposite direction — branching out from its enterprise market success with cloud services giant Amazon Web Services to the consumer market with Alexa. “Homepod was a failure; AI was a failure,” Ives said. “AirPods are nice, but it doesn’t move the needle.” Nevertheless, Apple is in an enviable position. “It’s the golden brand, and with that comes pressure as it goes into the next phase of growth around services,” Ives said. Wedbush estimates that the services market is only 15% penetrated, and with a total addressable market of $500 billion, it provides a floor in Apple shares even with all the noise, from iPhone sales slowing down to the trade war with China. “It is a key part of the Apple valuation story going forward, monetizing the platform.” But the company’s focus on services in recent years has been like the “drum roll” to the services initiative, which will really define the company’s future: streaming TV. “Their advantage is the installed devices, and as it becomes more of a distribution platform, as the consumer company and tech company definitions blur, what they need more is a distribution platform that capitalizes on the success as a consumer stalwart,” Ives said. Can Apple get the formula right? Ives is looking for 100 million consumers on the streaming platform within the next three years. “That is the goal, the main thing missing, and the biggest question mark.” How Apple gets there also remains to be seen, specifically, as it is forced into a much more significant content acquisition because it is playing from behind the eight ball and versus competition like Netflix and Disney spending a combined $20 billion. “They are spending a billion,” Ives said. Original content spending was a failure, or at least a disappointment in terms of total spend versus Netflix or Disney “R&D is the lifeblood of the future. What’s come out of Cupertino has always driven success, but what has been disappointing is that relative to what they are spending on R&D, they have not had the silver bullet growth initiatives,” Ives said. “The last one was AirPods, Apple Watch. Outside of that, few and far between for a company spending billions on R&D, and that’s why investors start to grow",error,513
1869," it is not on a technology search. It is “the great, unmet customer need” they have a history of finding. “They tried to put it on the wrist, and it has not worked as well.” There are still many places Apple can succeed, especially in the house, Robertson said, going up against Nest and other smart house sound and temperature and security devices. But he said Apple is “taking a long time to get there.” The device path has been the path for Apple to 2019, but it is not necessarily the future. “I’ve been studying innovation history for a while, and if you are lucky, you get a good run out of some advantage. The iPod lasted for a while and the iPhone is now losing its luster, but it had a 12-year run, pretty good,” Robertson said. The innovation expert, who wrote a book on Lego, said it had a nine-year run of sales that’s ending — Lego has had flat sales for three years now. Now Lego is seeing growth from non-product areas like movies and theme parks, its Discovery Centers.” For all big brands the biggest challenge is recreating the growth it had in the past. “Lego grew at a fairly steady clip, half a billion dollars per year for eight years, and at first that was a huge growth rate when it was only a $2 billion company, but just kept adding a half-billion to sales. That is what Apple is facing,” Robertson said. But the solution does not mean perfecting a single technology product in the R&D lab that breaks out. “It’s a customer challenge, not a technology challenge,” he said. “Stay focused on uncovering unmet needs in the customer base and finding cool ways to meet those needs.” Robertson said Apple has a chance in TV for a reason that relates to unmet need: “Who is satisfied with their TV offering now? It is such a mess.” “It’ll never launch a hardware product that will come even close to the success that it has had with the iPhone,” said Paul Meeks, CFA and portfolio manager of the Wireless Fund (WIREX) & Independent Solutions Wealth Management. Meeks said there hasn’t been a big enough “bang for the buck” with Apple’s R&D spending. While Cook",error,513
1885," focused its pricing strategy on that model too.” Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said he believes roughly 60 million to 70 million Apple users are due for an upgrade in China. Of course, not all of them will choose to upgrade to the newer phones. Still, Shah of Counterpoint Research, said he expects Apple shipment volumes to “barely cross” 30 million units this year, down from the 65 million at its peak in 2015. “So while the market has grown, Apple’s share has been declining and the user base is stagnant coming from new phone additions. Most additions are from refurb, second hand or used phones in circulation,” Shah said, referring to refurbished phones. Apple’s iPhone 11 series did not have a phone capable of connecting to 5G networks. These are next-generation mobile networks that promise super-fast data speeds with the ability to support technologies like driverless cars. 5G networks are slowly being rolled out around the world and in China they are slated to come online as early as this year. Apple’s rival Huawei will have two 5G smartphones on the market in China this year, while Xiaomi also currently has one on sale. Apple was not expected to release a 5G iPhone this year but some predict the company may do so in 2020. However, with 5G networks being built in China and the Chinese consumer known for looking for cutting-edge features, Apple could be at a disadvantage against local rivals. “While I didn’t expect it, I think the lack of a... 5G modem option will hurt sales in China,” Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, said in a note on Tuesday. 5G networks take time to roll out and widespread coverage is not instant. But over the next few years, they will offer a wider area of coverage and reliability. Apple is waiting for this to happen, analysts said. “The lack of 5G is little surprise. Whilst it stands to impact Apple in key markets such as China, Apple has opted to echo its approach with 3G and 4G by waiting for networks to be established so it can deliver 5G at scale with maximum impact,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said in a note on Wednesday.

Disappointment can come from seeing a systemic use of drugs and feeling like physicians barely spend any time with them during consultations. Exacerbating this, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and findings in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine have found a shortage and potentially dwindling number of board-certified sleep specialists.

The new ultra wide-angle lens is a lot of fun and can capture more people, or more of a scene, in a picture. When you don’t need that, there’s the regular wide-angle lens. And, since there are two cameras this year, I was finally able to take portrait pictures of my dog and objects, not just humans like on last year’s iPhone XR. Portrait pictures are the sort that blur the background of a picture to make it look more professional. Apple uses two cameras to do this, one to sense the depth of a subject. I also like Apple’s new “slowfies,” a new slo-mo mode for the front-facing camera that let me record myself in slow motion. I thought it would be a gimmick, but the effects are pretty funny — like me spinning around in my desk chair in slow motion, and I think people are going to have a lot of fun with it. Apple’s new color choices keep the phone fresh, particularly the green model Apple sent me that has a seafoam hue. You can choose from red, yellow, purple, white, blue or black, too, which should help it appeal to people who don’t want another boring phone color. The glass back adds a premium touch and it’s glossy like last year, with aluminum sides. I like the matte finish on the Pro models with the stainless steel accents, which looks even more premium. Apple also includes stereo speakers — something that similarly priced phones don’t always have — and it makes a difference when you’re watching a movie or listening to music. Instead of sounding like audio is coming out of  just one side of the device, audio fires from both sides with a surround-sound effect. I can’t think of much bad about the iPhone 11, but there are just some things that are better in the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, if you’re willing to pay at least $300 more. The 11 uses an LCD screen, for example, which means you don’t get the deep blacks and bright whites in movies that you do with the OLED panel on the more expensive iPhones. Most people probably won’t notice this, though people like me who play with gadgets all day",error,513
1899," definitely do. Also, Apple includes  only a 5W charger with the iPhone 11, which is too slow for a modern phone. It should have included the 18W charger that comes with the iPhone 11 Pro models, since it supports the ability to charge faster. If you do buy this (it costs about $40 from Apple or cheaper from Amazon), you can expect a 50% charge-up in about 30 minutes. Without it, you’re looking at several hours to juice up the phone. So, buy the 18W charger. Finally, I wish Apple made the screen run a little bit more to the sides of the phone. Like the iPhone XR last year, the black bezels around the edges are a little large compared with competing phones on the market from companies such as Samsung. It’s an aesthetic thing. First things first: What’s going on with those three cameras on the back? Kinda funky-looking, right? Last year, Apple had two lenses on its high-end phones: one regular camera and one 2x zoom camera. This year, there’s a third that adds the wide-angle lens that’s also on the regular iPhone 11. I took the iPhone 11 Pro Max out to lunch and used the regular wide-angle lens to capture a picture of a flag pole in front of the restaurant: Then the 2x zoom lens to get a closer look at the building: And then the super wide-angle camera to grab the entire scene: It captures a whole lot, and developers will build support into apps so that advanced camera professionals can shoot from different lenses at the same time, even while filming video. You also get the slowfie camera that’s on the regular iPhone 11 up front. These cameras work together to capture portrait pictures, which I still love to use for snaps of my dog, Mabel. Lots of other cameras do this now, but Apple remains one of the best at getting it right. Apple also added a new night mode to the camera, which is awesome. It brightens up the scene in dark areas, such as bars or just on a dimly lit street. You can see how well this works in two pictures my wife took of me outside a restaurant. This one is with night mode off: And here it is on: You can see how much brighter it is, and the colors pop way better. Some shots lose detail, especially if there isn’t at least some light source around you",error,513
1899,". The Google Pixel did better in one situation where there was very little light, for example. But, iPhone users who have never had this will like it a lot. Cameras aside, these also offer really good battery life. Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro Max is its longest-lasting iPhone, with 5 hours of additional battery life over last year’s iPhone XS Max. I found that iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts well beyond a normal day of use. In one case, I woke up at 2:45 a.m., drove up to San Francisco for TV, flew home to New York City and still had battery life when I finally got to bed at midnight Eastern. It had been in airplane mode for some of this, but I was still impressed. You can expect an additional 4 hours of battery life with the regular iPhone 11 Pro over last year’s iPhone XS, too. Point is: You get all-day battery life, which is still what mostly matters to me. Also, for the first time ever, Apple is including a fast charger in the box. The 18W unit lets you charge the iPhone to 50% in 30 minutes. So, even if you are running low, you’ll be able to fill up faster than before. The screen is great, especially if you like watching videos from iTunes like I do. I downloaded “John Wick 3,” which supports 4K HDR and surround sound audio from Dolby. It felt like a mini movie theater in my hand, on a par with the Galaxy Note 10+, which is also great for watching movies on the go. In normal use, though, the screen feels a lot like the iPhone XS Max from last year. But speaking of normal use: It seemed like it just whizzed around everything, especially when loading graphics-heavy games like Grimvalor or opening and closing apps. I don’t think last year’s iPhones are slow by any means, but this did feel just a hair faster at everything. You’ll really notice an upgrade if you’re coming from something like an iPhone 6 or iPhone 7, but keep in mind the performance will be similar on the cheaper iPhone 11, since it has the same A13 Bionic chip. There are a couple areas where I wish Apple had gone a little bit further. First, the screen seemed like it is prone to getting scratched pretty easily, and I thought I was keeping it protected. Buy a screen protector. Second,",error,513
1899," the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max all still support 7.5W wireless charging, which isn’t as fast as the 15W Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 10+ supports. Wireless charging can be slow, so I wish Apple had upped the ante here. On that topic, I also wish it added reverse wireless charging as some reports said it was going to, so that I could drop my AirPods on the back of the new iPhones to charge them up. It’s a feature Samsung has in its new phones, and it’s pretty fun. I also wish the Pro models moved to USB-C instead of Lightning. My MacBook Air and iPad Pro both use the new standard, and it would have made it a lot easier for me to just carry a single cable around. I get it, though: Fans are going to be mad whenever Apple does make this switch, since it means having to buy new accessories to replace Lightning. Finally, I noticed the cameras can sometimes be slow to focus, especially when moving between the lenses. I’ve seen this on other phones, and it fixes itself in about a second. It’s not a big deal and likely something Apple can fix in a software update. I still like the iPhone better than its Android competitors. Apple’s support is better than that of every other phone maker. You get software updates for years after you buy it — and, unlike lots of Android phones, right when that software is launched for all iPhones. And Apple’s ecosystem of services, which includes News and will soon include Apple TV+ and Arcade, is unmatched. If your iPhone is several years old or starting to wear out, the iPhone 11 series is worth a look. I feel like a ton of people I talk to still have an iPhone 6, iPhone 6s or iPhone 7. All of those people should consider the new iPhone 11 family and pick the one that fits them best. Almost everyone in this boat will find that the iPhone 11, which starts at $699, is the phone for them. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are for people who want the best iPhones you can buy today, and who are willing to pay for a better screen, better battery life, improved water-resistance and one more camera lens over what you get in the iPhone 11. It’s the phone you probably want if you’re a hardcore fan who uses Apple’s annual upgrade program and trades last",error,513
1901,"? A compass? Well, sure, maybe it’s useful for people during hikes if you need to know where to travel. But, more importantly, the magnetometer that enables the compass also allows you to open Apple Maps on the watch and see which way you’re facing, just like on an iPhone. On models that don’t have this, you just see a dot showing your location. With Series 5, there’s a glowing arc showing exactly which way you’re looking. It’s super helpful when you get out of a subway and don’t know which way to walk. Battery life is still rated at 18 hours, even with the always-on display. I mostly care about getting from about 6 a.m. until about 9 p.m., when I go to bed. It lasted that long for me with battery left over, but you may see battery life vary if you’re using GPS longer during runs or relying on a cellular connection instead of your cellphone to stream music or make phone calls. Those features can drain the battery a lot faster. Also, this is really cool: Apple is selling the Series 5 in a new way that lets you select exactly what model and band you want. It’s called “Apple Watch Studio.” You start by selecting the size (40mm or 44mm). Then you pick the case: aluminum starts at $399; stainless steel starts at $699; titanium starts at $799 and ceramic starts at $1,299. Next, you pick a band, either a sport loop or sport band. Or you can pay more for Apple’s luxury bands, like the modern buckle or milanese loop. This works either online or in stores, and I like that I was able to pick the band I wanted to match the watch. Previously, you didn’t get to pick the exact color. You sort of went with what Apple had for you and then bought whatever else you wanted. If you get a Nike or Hermes watch, you will select from those families of bands to match. Finally, Apple just kicks butt at software for the Apple Watch. I still love trying to close my activity circles every day (even if I’m not active enough), that I can compete with friends on my activities and see when they complete workouts, and that the Apple Watch can show me things like my heart rate, how many calories I burned during a workout and more. It can still do",error,513
1901," all the things the Series 4 did, like run an EKG, alert you if your heart rate is too high or too low, automatically call emergency services if you fall and more. Apple’s watchOS 6 software introduces a lot of new features that will also hit older Apple Watches, like female health tracking, indications when your environment is loud enough that it could damage your hearing and fun new watch faces. Still, I was really hoping Apple would implement sleep tracking, as some reports suggested it would. But Apple has long said it won’t do sleep tracking until it thinks it can do it right, and that’s fair. Other companies that do track sleep often do not give me enough information to tell me anything useful. A sleep score on a Fitbit, for example, would sometimes say I slept great even though I felt like junk in the morning. Or it would say I slept awful when I felt well rested the next day. I’m willing to wait for Apple to get this right and to make sure the battery lasts long enough through the night to do it. In the meantime, there are third-party apps that do track sleep, which you can try if you want to. I haven’t found them to be that great though. The always-on display works for the time and exercise, but it doesn’t work for all apps. When I have driving directions on, for example, the always-on display defaults to a clock. I need to wake the watch to see the next turn. The Maps mode doesn’t stay on, which would be useful for when I’m walking around the city. Apple Music also doesn’t support always-on. Finally, I’ve purchased every watch since the first model launched. My Series 2 watch had the sapphire display, which is only available on the more expensive stainless steel, titanium and ceramic models of the Series 4. I preferred this screen since it doesn’t scratch as easily. But you need to be willing to pay a lot more for it instead of the strengthened ion X glass on the aluminum models, which can still scratch kind of easily. Yes. Taking into consideration that 70% of Apple Watch buyers are new, then the Apple Watch Series 5 is worth buying. I don’t think you need to upgrade from the Series 4, and I don’t think Apple is really worried if people are planning to are not. I’m making the",error,513
1912,"ness bucks for classes, programs, and wearable devices like an Apple Watch.” Wellness Bucks, according to the company’s marketing materials, involve a reimbursement up to that amount to the member for the purchase of the device, and/ or participation in fitness classes or weight loss programs. Those who do not have a smartphone can opt for the fitness class, rather than the Apple Watch, which is a more commonly-offered benefit. Apple declined to comment on its collaboration with Devoted. In a statement, a spokesperson for Devoted Health said the company is moving to give its members “the tools they need to keep healthy outside of the doctor’s office.” “We are pleased that CMS agrees that there is a wide variety of ways that older Americans can keep healthy, including fitness and nutrition classes, and activity monitoring devices such as the Apple Watch,” said Devoted Health spokesman Kenneth Baer. “We are thrilled to be the first Medicare Advantage plan to collaborate with Apple, and give our members the chance to use their Devoted Health Wellness bucks towards purchasing an Apple Watch. Using innovative technologies to improve the quality of care is core to our mission.” Health experts say that Apple likely benefited from recent changes to the rules set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These changes, introduced earlier this year, allow plans to offer a greater flexibility of benefits, which have a reasonable expectation of improving the overall health of the member. For a plan like Devoted Health, which is still early in its rollout and currently has about four thousand members signed up, offering Apple Watch as a benefit is a way to set itself apart. Devoted has aggressive plans to scale to more than 100,000 members by 2023, according to a pitch deck obtained by Business Insider. Devoted is only available in in Florida, but the company has indicated that it will expand to other states like Texas in the coming years. “The recent (CMS) rule change is driving the move,” said Ari Gottlieb, the founder of A2 Strategy Group, which specializes in health insurance. “While many larger plans have been slow to adopt new benefits, this is an example of how challenged, start-up plans are seeking to create differentiation in the market to drive enrollment growth.” Several of the other Medicare Advantage plans contacted by CNBC said they are also considering an Apple Watch fitness benefit. “MA plans will want to utilize this information,”",error,513
1942," warn that fruit-growing regions in the U.S. will continue to be ravaged.   But for some struggling New York fruit growers, adapting to climate change and rising property values has become too difficult. Between 2012 and 2017, more than 2,000 farms closed in the state, representing a 6% drop in the number of farms statewide, according to the New York Farm Bureau. “A lot of farms in the Hudson Valley are being sold and built into housing developments,” Ryan said, walking along her row of ripe Asian pears and plucking a couple to store in her hat. Since 1982, real estate development has eaten away over 471,000 acres of the state’s farmland, according to data from the preservation group American Farmland Trust. “I’ve never known any farmer to just sell out,” Ryan said. “But after years of back-to-back crop losses, they can’t continue.” Lack of winter chilling and early bloom in the spring might seem like obvious problems, but climate change also poses a slew of other hardships for apple growers. For instance, warmer nights lead to the spread of pests and other diseases, and hot days in the winter sunburn the apple’s plant tissue. Warming temperatures also cause significant defects and pigment damage to developed fruit, making it impossible for growers to sell them on the market. If the nights don’t cool down enough, an apple that is supposed to turn red will turn brown or pink instead. Some farmers are turning to technology to protect against disasters, including irrigation systems for periods of drought, netting to protect against hail storms and giant wind machines that blow warm air onto the crops during cold spells to protect them from frost damage. The wind machines, which are large propane-powered fans with two 12-foot blades, mix rising warmer air with colder air closer to the ground. The fans raise the air temperatures around the apple trees by a few degrees, but aren’t always effective under extreme cold or windy conditions, functioning best between −4 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The machines exploded in popularity after the 2012 frost devastated apple harvests in New York. Researchers at Cornell University estimated that the number of wind machines in the state likely doubled between 2012 and 2013, and have since helped farmers protect their crops from frost damage. However, wind machines are expensive, and mostly used by larger-scale growers who can afford high-tech alternatives, according to Gregory Peck,",error,513
1942," a professor of horticulture at Cornell University. The machines can cost up to $10,000, and only cover roughly 10 acres. “The costs add up,” Peck said. “It’s a thousand here, a thousand there, and suddenly orchards are costing twice as much as they did to install.” In the Northeast U.S., a few apple growers have some irrigation equipment, but researchers say that most haven’t invested in enough equipment to optimize protections against periods of unexpected drought.  Adaptation is a gradual, decadeslong process for most fruit growers, whether they are turning to technology or changing the types of crops they are growing. While Ryan hopes to eventually install wind machines for her orchard, her focus now is on how to replace less-resilient apple varieties with different types that bloom later in the season and have roots that can withstand heavy wind, rain and drought conditions. In addition to planting larger, stronger trees, she’s harvesting weeds, baking pies and making hard cider from the apples that are hail damaged or dinged up. Ryan uses weeds like dandelion, purslane and chickweed for salad mixes, and sumac, rose hips and wind grapes for hard ciders. Like other farmers who are diversifying and trying to stay profitable, Ryan wakes up at 3:00 a.m. on some mornings to drive down to the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan to sell her cider, apples and baked goods. Those markets are often a lifesaver for farmers, she said. “I would be out of business without the farmers markets,” she said. “My farm would be a housing development. Period.” Ryan said she often feels like she’s running out of ideas for diversifying, and no longer expects a full harvest every year. Yet she remains optimistic. “We’re still in the game and we’re gonna fight like hell,” she said. The ramifications of climate change on the entire food system will be immense. But the problem is not yet obvious for most U.S. consumers, in part because a destroyed harvest in one region of the country could be masked by a better harvest in another. “Farmers carry most of the risk, and get less of the returns,” Peck said. “It’s not just about the cost to farmers. Climate change is pervasive, and the negative impacts on all crops is so fundamental",error,513

1964,"1 devices in the wild, and analysts say that with the exception of the Microsoft Surface, no one really has come up with a compelling model. Apple, with its stronghold over its own hardware, software and chips, might have an opportunity to do what it did with tablets the first time around and remake the 2-in-1 market, pulling share from mobile PCs that command the enterprise market. “Apple has high hopes for the enterprise market. I suspect there will be an overlap with detachables and laptops,” Guenveur said. “Apple has the most loyal customers in the world — we’re talking like 95% loyalty — and it’s good at getting a person to buy one product and move them up the SKU level; you start with an iPhone, they get an iPad, then a MacBook.”  Laptops are the world’s choice for work, and machines running Windows dominate. But as Apple responds by beefing up the iPad’s processing power and evolves its design to make it more comfortable for the daily grind — typing, navigating screens by mouse and trackpad — it’s likely that the tablet-turned-detachable will continue to have a starring role in Apple’s lineup. It’s still anyone’s guess, though, how blurry the line becomes between iPads and MacBooks.  Apple declined to comment. One thing is clear: Apple is catering to laptop PC users with its latest iPad offerings. In September 2019 the company announced iPadOS, its tablet-specific operating system that makes it more efficient to multitask, browse and use web-based apps like Google Docs. It also supports the use of a trackpad or mouse, both for its own keyboards and a host of ones made by third parties, which will make the iPad more appealing. Jess Lee, COO of software developer community DEV, recently switched from a laptop to the iPad for better mobility when she travels. Much of what she uses the iPad for falls under productivity — web-conferencing colleagues or using it as a second monitor when she is using her laptop — but “as a full-time machine, it’s not fully comfortable,” she says. “It’s the nature of the iPad being smaller than a laptop.” Bradley Chambers, a writer at tech news site 9to5Mac and IT director at Brainerd Baptist School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who oversees a stock of",error,513
1964," iPads used by administrators and students, says Apple has more work to do. “I want to see Apple move the iPad imparity with the Mac,” he says. “It’s one thing to spend 30 minutes on an iPad in a classroom, but if you think about knowledge workers outside of education, the ergonomics of the iPad aren’t great — not for eight hours. I want to see Apple evolve the use of the cursor with an iPad.” The latest iPad Pro aims to tackle this problem with its new OS. Its new Magic Keyboard, which is backlit and fit with a trackpad and cursor support, attaches magnetically to the device — sort of suspending it in the air — and is adjustable up to 130 degrees. Apple also stated in a release that the iPad Pro’s new A12Z Bionic chip makes it “faster and more powerful than most Windows PC laptops.” While that remains to be seen for most workers tied to less costly legacy laptops and desktops, there are some sectors where tablets sales — and presumably the detachables slowly phasing them out — continue to grow. “iPads present imagery better, which is really important in our industry,” says Kristin Savilia, CEO of Joor, whose software digitizes the wholesale process for fashion, home and beauty brands and about 200,000 retailers. “Think about shopping from a consumer perspective. If you can see the details more beautifully, you’re more apt to buy that product. It’s the same in B2B, with 200,000 stores using this technology to decide whether or not a product makes sense in their store. To see it beautifully on the iPad matters and makes a difference.” Joor has thousands of clients using its software on iPads in the field, but many of them return to the office to use its laptop version to crunch numbers and place orders. “It’s taking what each product is best at and making use for that,” Savilia said. Until the productivity gains promised by the iPad Pro become widespread, the detachables market remains niche. Compounding this is the issue of bundling and price. While the largest iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch display starts at $999, adding in the Wi-Fi plus cellular version — which you’ll want with new 5G networks, according to analysts — makes it $1,149. You also pay $",error,513
1964,"349 if you want Apple’s new keyboard (although tablets accessories company Brydge sells a comparable one for $230) and $129 for the Apple Pencil. “The iPad Pro looks more toward productivity rather than just pure consumption,” says David McQueen, research director at ABI Research. Given the accessories ecosystem you have to invest in to make the iPad Pro the best workhorse, “it can be quite pricey,” he says. Apple might find a wider market for the iPad if it bundled accessories like Apple Pencil and the new keyboard with touchpad, but the accessories deliver high profit margins. Apple does offer discounted pricing for students, teachers and school administrators, and there’s room for a detachable iPad in the U.S. education market, where Google Chromebooks have dominated since 2014 due to their low cost and ease of deployment. “If your main goal is to be a Google Docs client, then Chromebooks is a perfect suite for school,” says Chambers of tech news site 9to5Mac, whose school just finished a four-year stint using the iPad Air. He’s rolling out the new seventh-generation iPad in the fall. “But for anything past that, the iPad is a better device with its wide variety of apps and better support.” According to market research firm Futuresource Consulting, Chromebooks accounted for 59.9% of mobile devices shipped to K–12 classrooms in 2019, up from 58.1% in 2017. Windows devices grew from 21.7% to 22.5% over the same period. While consumer familiarity with Apple’s ecosystem and its strong proposition on data privacy issues bodes well for the iPad maker here, iPad share fell from 14.8% to 13.8%. Mac laptops currently hold 3.4% of the sector. “In terms of the evolution of computing battles in the future, we expect Microsoft and Google to push hard on 2-in-1 devices, designed specifically for education at increasingly aggressive sub-$300 price points,” says Michael Boreham, a senior consultant at Futuresource. “Many in the industry believe the 2-in-1 format to be ideal for education, with tactile touch suited for some applications, while a keyboard is typically required for more traditional tasks. How Apple will respond to this trend will be interesting to watch.” Waiting for Apple to respond to, and eventually dominate, mobile technology sectors has become a",error,513
1974," of supporting older iPhone models, you can expect the new iPhone SE to last you at least three years before it starts feeling outdated The cameras are great. Apple says the iPhone SE has the best single-camera sensor it has ever launched. That means it’s better than the 2018 iPhone XR, which costs more. It’s tough to disagree with Apple’s claims: The pictures look really good, and Apple includes portrait mode (and all of the fancy lighting effects you can apply) on the front and back cameras. I was so surprised at the clarity of a picture I took of myself (above) that I sent it to my colleague. I’m not used to this sort of picture quality from a $399 phone. You don’t get all of Apple’s fancy stuff, though. The ultra wide-angle lenses and zoom cameras are saved for its more expensive phones.  Apple also kept other features that you’d normally see in a flagship phone. The iPhone SE is water and dust resistant, so you can accidentally drop it in a pool. It has decent stereo speakers that fire from the top and bottom of the phone, or left and right when you hold it in landscape. They’re not amazing, but they sound clearer than you’d normally get from a single speaker at this price. I also love that the iPhone SE includes wireless charging and fast charging. To use the fast charger, which will speed up how long you have to keep it plugged in, you’ll need to buy a $29 18W plug. Apple includes a 5W charger in the box. The screen isn’t as sharp or colorful as Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro phones, but it uses the same LCD display technology as Apple’s iPhone 11 and iPhone XR. That includes TrueTone, a feature that automatically adjusts the white balance on the screen so it’s more accurate and easier to view based on the lighting in the room. Movies are admittedly much smaller on this screen, but they still look good. And speaking of a tinier screen, it’s been a few years since I’ve spent a considerable amount of time with a 4.7-inch iPhone. Apple says it has sold more than 500 million 4.7-inch iPhones, including the super popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. My wife, who is used to seeing me with Apple’s really big phones, thought I was carrying",error,513
1974," the (much smaller) iPod touch when she first saw it. Anyway, I was fascinated by how small the phone felt given how much power it has inside. Finally: you may have heard a lot about 5G. It’s rolling out around the U.S. from the major wireless carriers and can offer much faster speeds depending on where you are. Don’t worry about that right now. The iPhone SE supports the fastest Gigabit 4G LTE networks that are available everywhere and the newest Wi-Fi 6 standard where it’s available. It’s plenty fast and, in fact, where I live at home, faster than T-Mobile’s 5G network because of the way it’s rolling out right now. In a year or so, 5G may be more important for future-proofing your smartphone, but don’t stress about it today. It’s tough to be critical of an inexpensive phone with a great camera, powerful processor and features you normally find in phones at twice the price. The battery is smaller than Apple’s bigger phones, so you’ll find it drains pretty quickly if you’re playing lots of games and streaming movies. You’ll get to the end of the day if you’re spending more time just surfing the web and texting, so it’s good enough for most people and I don’t really have any complaints. It also doesn’t include the same U1 chip that Apple’s iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro have. That really doesn’t mean much right now, but Apple is rumored to launch something called AirTags which may let you use the U1 chip to find lost items attached to AirTags. It’s totally possible the iPhone SE will still work with them using Bluetooth or some other technology, though. We don’t know enough about AirTags or how useful they’ll be yet. And finally, there’s no headphone jack. I ditched headphones years ago for AirPods and haven’t looked back. But, if you’re like my wife and still like using wired headphones, you’ll need to use the pair in the box that plug into the charging port. You can also use an adapter for your regular headphones. When I reviewed the iPhone 11 in September, I said it was the best iPhone for most people. But we’re in a vastly changed",error,513
1975," I loved that I could swipe across it with three fingers to quickly switch apps. And there are lots of shortcuts (just hold down the command key in any app to see what they are) depending on the app you’re using. It’s smaller than you might expect on a MacBook, but there’s plenty of room for moving the mouse without your finger running out of space and hitting the edges. There’s white backlighting on the keys that adjusts depending on how bright the room is (it uses the same sensor built into the iPad that controls auto-brightness.) This, too, is an upgrade from the regular Smart Keyboard which had no such lighting, and makes it easier to see the keys in the dark.  The combo of iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard feels rock solid, like a laptop. The iPad Pro attaches using Apple’s Smart Connector, which pairs it automatically every time. The grip is good and I like that you can tilt the iPad to adjust viewing angles. It’s a little top heavy, though. It rolled off the side of my bed during testing, for example. At least the keyboard stayed attached. Finally, there’s so-called “pass-through” charging, so you plug in your iPad into a small USB-C port on the side of the keyboard. That’s more convenient than running the cable right to its normal spot on the side of the iPad (which otherwise kind of makes it look like you’re charging your laptop by plugging in the screen.) It’s important to know that the Magic Keyboard only works with the more recent 2018 and 2020 models of iPad Pro -- Apple’s most expensive tablet, which starts at $799 for the 11-inch model and $999 for the 12.9-inch model. It won’t do anything with more basic iPads, nor will it work with the original iPad Pros that had home buttons. The keyboard itself isn’t perfect. There isn’t a row of function keys for pausing or playing music, adjusting the brightness of the screen or keyboard backlighting or changing the volume. Those would have been helpful.  There’s also inconsistency in how apps work. Some apps work really well. Apple Notes, for example, will automatically change the mouse circle (it’s not an arrow like on other products) to a cursor for selecting text when you hover over something you’ve written. But it",error,513
1975,"’s more difficult to select text in apps like Microsoft Word, which haven’t been updated to fully support the new mouse -- with Word, you just have to hover the circle over the text you want to change. Other apps have different problems. I tested an app called Splashtop that let me control my Windows computer (it’s great), for example, and kept having to tap a keyboard button so that it would recognize it. I also wish Apple Arcade games (and games in general) supported the keyboard so I could control my character with keys, like you would on a laptop. Also, the keyboard is really heavy. Most people buy iPads because they’re light and portable, but the keyboard seems to roughly double the weight of the iPad or (anecdotally since Apple doesn’t list the weight) about as heavy as a MacBook Air when you combine the 12.9-inch iPad and the Magic Keyboard. I think it’s worth it, but some people might find it’s too heavy. Finally, I wish there was somewhere to store the optional $129 Apple Pencil, which is a nice add-on for drawing on the screen and taking notes. You can attach it to the top of the iPad, but it would be nice if there was a small area to tuck it away on the side so the Apple Pencil was stowed away when you close the iPad, like Microsoft has with its Surface Pro X. Otherwise, I find it just falls off a lot when I move around. The Magic Keyboard costs $300 if you buy the model for the 11-inch iPad Pro, or $350 for the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro. That means it costs about as much as Apple’s entry-level $329 iPad. That’s a hefty price to tack on to a tablet that already starts at $799. If you just need a keyboard sometimes and don’t care much about the mouse support, get Apple’s Smart Keyboard, which starts at $179. But if you’ve already bought into the idea that an iPad could replace your laptop and spent $800 or more on an iPad Pro, this keyboard makes that idea a reality.  It’s a tough time to recommend such an expensive keyboard when millions of people have lost their jobs. But this is also a time when millions of people are also changing how they work. And if it means the difference between spending hundreds or thousands on a new",error,513
1979," period of time.” iPhone revenue was down to $28.96 billion, a 7% year-over-year decrease. The shortfall was partially made up by a 16% rise in services revenue, which include iCloud, Apple Music, and other subscriptions, to $13.34 billion. Total revenue growth for the quarter decreased to 0.5% from 9% a quarter ago. CFO Luca Maestri said that iPhone performance will be worse, on a year-to-year basis, in the June quarter than it was in the March quarter.  “On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter, relative to the March quarter.  On iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter,” Maestri said.  Cook said that the company’s TV subscription service, Apple TV+, was doing well as more people watched content while under lockdown, and that people were turning to iPad and Mac, the company’s larger computers, in increasing numbers.  “It’s clearly helping the iPad and the Mac and, for that reason … we envision both of those to have improving year-over-year performances in this current quarter,” Cook told CNBC. “If you look at TV+ as an example, we’ve seen a significant uptick in the number of people that are viewing content as well as the engagement with content.” Apple’s cash hoard now stands at $192.8 billion, down from $207.1 billion at the end of the previous quarter.   Apple’s stores around the world, except in China and one location in Korea, are shuttered until further notice. But the company said that sales in its online store combined with its retail stores reached a record in March, and Tim Cook told CNBC “the growth was off the charts” online. Cook also said that the company plans to reopen its retail stores with a “much reduced number of people in the store.” Cook also noted that Apple was able to launch new products, including new iPad Pro and MacBook Air models, during a quarter in which many of Apple’s employees at its California headquarters started to work from home amid the coronavirus pandemic.  This story is developing.

1980," working from home, knowledge workers able to work remotely and be productive but need new systems for collaboration.” He said remote work is one change that will become permanent and will require many more software solutions never thought about before by organizations.  “You never wish for a crisis to support your sector, but I think it will grow even more than forecast, partly because we will head into a downturn and that will put more cost pressure on organizations solving complex digital problems,” the Claris CEO said. “In a strong market, they could solve it with a bigger budget and industrial-strength solutions, but we are going to see a more pragmatic approach.” There are concerns that a prolonged economic slump will lead to a greater focus from IT managers on cost-cutting in software, which has grown to represent 50% of the enterprise since the financial crisis, when it was IT hardware that saw the steep cuts. “Right now we’re substantially in investment mode for R&D talent and think there will be significant hiring opportunities in the post-pandemic economy,” Freitag said. “In a recession, people have to get creative on value justification. We’ll be happy to go up against big vendors in terms of business case justification,” said the Claris CEO, who worked at Oracle for more than a decade.  Freitag is not alone in seeing a major opportunity now. John Rymer, a cloud analyst at Forrester Research who coined the term low code, tells CNBC, “We think this will have a profound impact too on the move to low code.”  But Rymer stressed that the case is more logical than proven at this point. “What we are seeing is companies that are already in the game, already working with a low code vendor, we’re seeing them expand utilization, but we have not seen as many new companies coming into the market,” he said. “I think we are being reminded once again that there are lots of people who are not aware of low code or sold on it, or in the market for it yet. But I am waiting for it, waiting for the pain to become so great that new customers start to recognize it and come in,” Rymer said. Rymer noted a report he recently reviewed about a hospital taking weeks to build a visitor tracking app during the Covid-19 outbreak, which could be developed in low code in a day, as a",error,513
1980," logical use case for an organization that should soon see the logic of the low code approach. “We see the potential for a big moment,” Rymer said. “In health care, government and education there are unending new use cases,” he added. Claris says it has seen a spike in inbound inquiries amid the crisis, including both ongoing tech support and new customers, with big spikes in health care, education and the logistics sector.  “Logistics was new to me, but it makes sense... trucking, shipping parcels. It makes perfect sense given how much happens at small and mid-sized companies and not just Amazon,” Freitag said. Starting from March 1, before Covid-19 was a major issue across the U.S., through the peak period of the crisis, the spike has been as high as 50%, he said.  “We’ve been doing this for several decades. This is our heritage, extracting away complexity,” Freitag said. The Claris CEO cited a reason for increased interest in low code that also has been cited by Alphabet’s Google Cloud and Microsoft, which are placing greater focus on low-code solutions for enterprise clients to capitalize on the need among companies for less complex coding solutions that can lead to faster project completion across more business functions. That reason is the scarcity of comp sci grads to staff roles. Microsoft expects 500 million new apps to be built in the next half decade, which is more than all the apps built in the last 40 years. “If that’s true, 450 million have to be built with a low-code tool,” Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of the citizen applications platform at Microsoft, recently told CNBC. “There are not enough humans to code fast enough to build that many.” “Recruiting was hyper-competitive before, and that will favor low code, more broad emphasis on reskilling and upskilling talent that want to pick up technical skills. Prosperity will be created by individuals who get these low-code skills,” Freitag said. Claris current works with Amazon Web Services, but as the competition between the big cloud platforms becomes more intense, Claris will probably expand with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, Freitag said, even though the Apple subsidiary has not partnered with them previously. Like many low-code companies, “we’re agnostic by philosophy",error,513
1980,",” Freitag said. Meeting a variety of customer preferences mean it makes sense for Claris tools to become available across more platforms. Some customers may prefer Google Cloud because of existing use of G Suite tools, while others may prefer to not use Google due to their views on privacy policy. Customers may also be more likely to move from one cloud provider to another in a more competitive market based on price and a period of contract renegotiations, and requests for better terms could be forced by an economic downturn. Rymer said it makes sense for Claris to move to a multi-cloud approach to evolve from its history, too, which has focused more on what is referred to as on-premise service. “They have tons of customers running ‘on prem,’ but the future is in the cloud, and that is where new demand is,” said the Forrester cloud analyst. “On-prem software will exist for long term,” Freitag said, but he added, “the cloud is about affordability and rapid up-time and scale.” Apple’s enterprise business has focused more on selling computers than software. Apple does not disclose FileMaker sales, but Claris is profitable — and has been for more 20 years, Freitag told CNBC at the time of a rebranding under the Claris name last summer. “For any company coming under cost pressure, and with IT a cost center, they will know that they can’t give a marketer a Java stack, but they can give them reasonable governance about a low-code stack and that gives them more job security too,” Freitag said, explaining that low code provides staff outside of core IT a way to upskill themselves.  Unlike parent company Apple, which is seeing big growth from its services business and newer areas like subscriptions to TV and music streaming, Claris has no goal to go directly to consumers. The low code company has over 50,000 business customers and millions of FileMaker downloads, with a sweet spot among small to medium-sized businesses with between 100 to 1,000 employees across many industries and business units. And it is not a U.S.-centric business, with 58% of its customers overseas and 42% in the U.S., a business mix Freitag does not expect to change soon. The company has most recently launched its Claris Connect enterprise product which enables users to connect and integrate services like Slack and Dropbox with their",error,513
1983," as useful to me in the browser, where you can access bookmarks or a URL bar. Some people prefer hardware function keys (the F keys) and hate the touch bar, but I don’t mind it. Regardless, you can’t buy a MacBook Pro without it, so might as well get used to it. The speakers sound solid, too, but they’re not nearly as full sounding as what you get from Apple’s super high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro. Still, they’re better than what I have on a similarly priced HP laptop sitting on my desk. And Apple’s microphones are great, too, with the ability to cut out background noise so you sound as clear as possible on a call. They’re so good that I usually switch to using the MacBook Pro’s mics instead of the ones on my AirPods during calls. And, not to beat on it too much, but I love typing on the keyboard. The spacing is just right, the arrow keys are easy to reach and I have way fewer typos than I did on the older butterfly design. I love that I can really feel the keys push down while I’m typing and that it’s quiet. It also doesn’t feel as sticky as the keys on other laptops (like my HP.) I think it’s the best keyboard you can buy on a laptop right now. There’s also plenty of power in the MacBook Pro. Apple sent me its higher-end $1,799 with the newer Intel 10th generation processor and four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports to test. The entry-level model has eighth-generation chips that Apple says are still more powerful than what you get in a MacBook Air, but I wasn’t able to test that version in time for the review. So, I did most of my testing on the more expensive model, which was able to handle running the main display and two 23-inch monitors with plenty of tabs open, music playing and more. The same situation felt a bit sluggish on Apple’s more affordable MacBook Air. The $1,799 model also has four Thunderbolt ports, instead of just two in the cheaper versions. That let me plug in and and charge an external keyboard or mouse, or my iPhone, without having to use a dock or unplug a monitor. I’m still testing battery life, but Apple promises 10 hours of web surfing. That",error,513
1983," typically is mostly true if you have the screen dimmed down below the top brightness and use Safari instead of Google Chrome. But, you should be able to get through most of a workday as long as you’re not slamming it with power-heavy tasks like video editing. If you are, plug it in. One more thing I want to point out: I’ve sort of always assumed the 13-inch MacBook Pro is much bigger than the MacBook Air. It really isn’t. It measures just about the same, just thicker across the whole body instead of tapering to a thin design, and weighs 3.1 pounds compared with 2.8 pounds for the MacBook Air. I like the added power here. One thing that stood out to me compared with the MacBook Air is that the fans can get pretty loud at times. I was editing photos for a story while on a Slack video call with colleagues (and running two external screens) and the fans were blowing loud enough that it was sometimes hard to hear people on the call. It’s not overwhelming, but you notice it. And this is by design, since the fans need to spin to keep the processor cool and the computer running. Also, Apple still includes a 720p webcam while other companies, like Microsoft, have moved on to much better 5-megapixel sensors. That wasn’t always a huge deal to me, but it’s much more noticeable now that we’re all home doing video chats. I really wish Apple would boost the camera quality. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is probably my new favorite MacBook. It’s perfect if you want a lightweight workhorse that can do some photo and video editing, run several external displays at the same time and run lots of apps without slowing down. The 16-inch MacBook Pro that starts at $2,399 has better speakers and dedicated graphics for more powerful editing, but it’s a lot bigger and heavier. Then there’s the $999 MacBook Air, which I still think is the best MacBook for most people — it’s fine for running lots of apps and generally doing most things outside of video editing.  The 13-inch MacBook Pro sits right between the two, in price and capability. I like that it has the power to hook up to a bunch of screens and can run everything I need when I’m at my desk, and that it’s not much heavier than a MacBook Air when I carry it",error,513
1990," month and on Friday closed above the  psychological 3,500 level.  The S&P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said. Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%. “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic. “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.” Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.  “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said. Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart. “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.

2009," Nasdaq was off 3.7%, shedding more than 426 points. The S&P 500 was off just 119 points, sliding to 3,271, under the key 3,300 level. Tech was the worst hit of the major sectors, down 4.3%. Communications services fell 4%. That sector includes Facebook and Alphabet. “This is just a perfect negative storm right now,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. He expects the sell-off to continue into the election, and after if there’s no winner. “Price reaction to almost all of FANG reporting after the bell Thursday could make this more extreme,” he said. FANG stocks include Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, but the group of high-fliers has also come to include Microsoft and Apple. “Downside momentum seems to be building here. People just want out,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Rupkey points out that the sell-off is happening as Big Tech CEOs like Twitter’s Jack Dorsey testify before Congress but traders did not tie the decline in Nasdaq to that hearing. “It’s the increases in virus, and its some of the tech leaders have fallen off. We never really regained back to September, and those September highs were all made on tech,” Rupkey said. Emanuel said the selling could have a ways to go. For the time being, we think the pressure will remain on the market with an eventual retest of the 200-day moving average, either before or after the vote,” he said. The 200-day on the S&P 500 is just about 3,130. The 200-day moving average is based on an average of the last 200 closing values, and it is often seen as a sign of support. Redler said if the S&P 500 can’t recover its 100-day moving average at 3,300, it will likely test the 200-day, which is also the same level as the June lows. “It’s all of these things coming together. It is basically the new certainty that the virus is accelerating sharply and the certainty that we’re not going to get any stimulus before the election,” said Emanuel. Some strategists expect a blue wave, with a Democratic sweep of Congress and White House, but the election is difficult to call with early voting already in",error,513
2038," use. I took the Apple Watch Series 4 off of the charger on Friday morning. I drove to the beach that evening and realized I’d forgotten my charger. I turned it off Saturday night and still had 16 percent left on Sunday at 3 p.m. I’d worn the Apple Watch all day each day, and even used it to track workouts and make sure I closed all of my rings. That’s good enough for me. I like the new digital crown on the side, which is used to navigate around apps. It provides haptic feedback — a little buzz — when you twist it, and you can press it to make a selection. Also, the button below it that brings up the app tray is now more flush with the rest of the body, which is just a tiny aesthetic enhancement. At its launch event last week, Apple showed off a new electrocardiogram feature that exists inside the digital crown, but it’s not active right now. Apple will release a software update that will enable it later this year, but when it works it’ll let you take an EKG and send it off to your doctor via PDF. The new software for Apple Watch has a lot of fun new features that will land on older Apple Watch models. It has automatic workout tracking, for example, but it can take a bit to kick in. After about a third of a mile it asked if I was running and if I wanted to record my workout. I confirmed I was jogging indoors, and it gave me back credit for the distance I had already run, which was really neat. The watchOS 5 system also has a new walkie-talkie option that lets you talk to other Apple Watch owners on the fly, just like a normal walkie-talkie, but I didn’t have any friends who had the new software or a new watch, so I couldn’t test it. I love the new Apple Watch faces that are in watchOS 5, and many were designed to take advantage of the larger display on the new edition. There’s one mode that looks like the Apple Watch face is burning, which just looks cool. But my favorite one lets me set 8 different complications, so I can quickly do things like access the exercise app, the weather and check my heart rate. Another neat feature inside watchOS 5 on the new Apple Watch is automatic fall detection. It’s off by default, but when I turned it on, it",error,513

We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures. We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg’s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple. While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us. We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate. Apple has always believed in being transparent about the ways we handle and protect data. If there were ever such an event as Bloomberg News has claimed, we would be forthcoming about it and we would work closely with law enforcement. Apple engineers conduct regular and rigorous security screenings to ensure that our systems are safe. We know that security is an endless race and that’s why we constantly fortify our systems against increasingly sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals who want to steal our data. The published Businessweek story also claims that Apple “reported the incident to the FBI but kept details about what it had detected tightly held, even internally.” In November 2017, after we had first been presented with this allegation, we provided the following information to Bloomberg as part of a lengthy and detailed, on-the-record response. It first addresses their reporters’ unsubstantiated claims about a supposed internal investigation: Despite numerous discussions across multiple teams and organizations, no one at Apple has ever heard of this investigation. Businessweek has refused to provide us with any information to track down the supposed proceedings or findings. Nor have they demonstrated any understanding of the standard procedures which were supposedly circumvented. No one from Apple ever reached out to the FBI about anything like this, and we have never heard from the FBI about an investigation of this kind — much less tried to restrict it. In an appearance this morning on Bloomberg Television, reporter Jordan Robertson made further claims about the supposed discovery of malicious chips, saying, “In Apple’s case, our understanding is it was a random spot check of some problematic servers that led to this detection.” As we have previously informed Bloomberg,",error,513
2044,". The report also says the audio recordings were uploaded to Khashoggi’s iCloud account, but that’s unlikely unless his watch had a connection to the internet without his phone. Some observers have pointed to photos of Khashoggi wearing a version of the Apple Watch that can connect to cellular data networks. But that model of the Apple Watch is incompatible with cellular networks in Turkey, according to Apple’s own carrier list, and the audio files could’ve been uploaded that way. It is possible Khashoggi’s watch could have connected his watch to the internet over the consulate’s Wi-Fi network. However, that would mean Khashoggi would have had to connect his watch to the consulate’s Wi-Fi during a previous visit. That way, his watch would’ve automatically connected to the consulate’s Wi-Fi when he entered the building on the day of his alleged killing. If Khashoggi hadn’t connected his watch to the consulate’s Wi-Fi network during a previous visit, the only other way he could have connected to it would be if he had time to input the password into his watch face moments after he walked into the consulate. The latest watch software from Apple, watchOS 5, was released a few weeks ago and allows users to manually input Wi-Fi passwords by using the device’s “Scribble” feature, which lets users draw characters on the screen to input text. It’s unlikely Khashoggi would have had time to do that if he was under attack. Then there’s the question of what app Khashoggi could have used to record from his Apple Watch. Apple does not ship the Apple Watch with a recording app, but there are several third-party apps that enable audio recording on the watch. But Apple’s privacy rules require third-party recording apps to display a red indicator on the watch’s screen while it’s recording audio, so anyone who looked at the watch would know they were being recorded. Third-party recording apps can send audio files to the cloud via Apple’s iCloud service, but those files can only be retrieved by the iPhone version of the app. It’s possible Khashoggi’s fiancee had access to the iPhone version of a recording app, but she has so far made no public mention of any recordings, and it’s not",error,513
2073," magazine covers, which make the app feel a bit more alive. I preferred the magazines with this improved formatting, and I hope others adopt it in the coming months. Also, you don’t need to open the magazines to find some of the most popular stories within their pages. If you just click the Apple News+ tab in the News app, you’ll see a curation of stories about travel, fitness, music, business and other topics that are gathered from all of the magazines in the library. There are also sections that show highlights for Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times stories, which I liked. I also like that I can save magazines to read when my iPad or iPhone doesn’t have a connection, such as on a train or an airplane. My iPad doesn’t have cellular, for example, so this content wouldn’t otherwise be available unless I had Wi-Fi. Finally, I also love the option that lets me save a story to read later. That means I can pick up my iPad or iPhone at another time, see the stories I want to read, and pick up right where I left off. Unfortunately, Apple News+ doesn’t support other services that also do this, such as Pocket or Instapaper. You’re locked into Apple News, and this can be frustrating at times. You have to read it in an app on an iPad, iPhone or Mac. I preferred reading on an iPad, since the text is nice and large and I felt more like I was relaxing with a magazine. It works just OK on a Mac and is perfectly fine on an iPhone if you want to browse for stories to read later. Apple needs to go beyond these devices, though. Apple should consider building a web version of Apple News+ that could appeal to not only owners of its products but also to PC users. At work, for example, I use a Windows 10 computer. I can’t read any of the stories that I’ve saved to read later or browse new content. Also, because you’re required to read in the app, this sometimes gets in the way of how people actually consume news. For instance, if a friend sends you a link to a story they liked in The Wall Street Journal, it’s not necessarily easy to pull it up. Just because you have a subscription to the Journal in Apple News+ does not mean you can access that subscription on the Journal’s website or app. There’",error,513
2073,"s an option to “Open in News” in Apple News+ if you choose “Share,” but it doesn’t always work and usually just lands me on the Journal homepage of the app. You’ll spend time trying to dig for the story instead of actually reading it. Apple should create an easy way to open any link inside its Apple News app. Also, Apple News+ can be buggy at times. The app crashes on me about once a day, which isn’t a big deal, but more often it fails to load the big image at the top of a story. Unless I scroll down, I can’t tell that the story has already loaded. Until I knew this, I often just stared at a blank screen wondering why the story hadn’t appeared. I wish Apple was able to get other news providers on board, too. I pay for The Washington Post and The New York Times separately, but Apple did not get deals with those publishers at launch. I don’t mind paying for either service, and I can still see premium content from them inside Apple News by linking my accounts, but I could save money each month if those subscriptions were also included in the $9.99 Apple News+ fee. Tough call. It totally depends on how you consume the news. If you’re like my father-in-law and read newspapers cover to cover every day, then this isn’t for you. If you consume news on your iPhone or iPad, then maybe it is. I dig the service because I get access to The New Yorker and Vanity Fair as part of the $9.99 subscription, which saves me the money I was paying for those services separately. Plus, I get content from The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, to which I didn’t subscribe, and access to around 300 magazines. I like that I can dig into a bunch of those magazines when I’m looking to unwind at the end of the day, or that I can save some to read before I get on the train or a flight. But you don’t need to buy this if you don’t already pay for magazines, have no interest in reading them or don’t frequently read news on your iPhone or iPad. If you haven’t already, I suggest just getting acclimated with the free Apple News app — which curates free content from around the internet — to see if you like that",error,513
2078,"’s core businesses which will drive a higher valuation in addition to higher earnings power. We view Qualcomm as the clear leader in 5G modem technology which should begin to ramp through CY2H2019 and 2020.” “On the positive side for QCOM 1) the settlement will be an immediate bump to QTL license revenue starting in the JunQ and a $5-7B catchup payment with iPhone product insertion in 2H20(F21E), 2) the new six-year license agreement provides a 5G opportunity at Apple, 3) QCOM sees an incremental ~$2 EPS/year as product ramps in F21E.” “We expect the 5G chip supply agreement and the resumption of ongoing licensing royalties to add ~$2.00 in EPS to our F2021 estimates for QCOM … While we view the settlement as encouraging and as removing a major overhang for QCOM, we remain Sector Weight, as we believe the economic benefit from the AAPL settlement is largely reflected in the stock.” “We believe Qualcomm’s strong R&D investments and leadership in 5G modems was the key factor in Apple reaching a settlement with Qualcomm. In fact, we believe Apple and Qualcomm needed to start working together by April in order for Apple to launch 5G enabled smartphones for its September 2020 iPhone launch timeframe.” “Coupled with our expectation for Qualcomm to have a high share in 5G overall, we believe the deal drives in excess of $7/share earnings power for FY21. While we believe the stock’s risk/reward was favorable in the $50s even amid uncertainty prior to the settlement, the stock is still only trading at ~10x that FY21 earnings power. Given greatly reduced uncertainty given licensing agreements with Samsung, China, and now Apple, we think it’s reasonable to argue for multiple expansion, and raise our price target to $85.” “We believe the deal could be positive for Qualcomm given the restoration of licensing and chipset revenue and we estimate the deal could total an additional $7.0 billion and $1.55 EPS accretion to our C20 revenue and EPS estimates of $22.5 billion and $3.57 respectively. We expect Qualcomm’s other customers will pursue similar royalty and chipset pricing if Apple gets a good deal.” “We see Tuesday’s settlement as a positive step, clearing legal overhangs while bringing",error,513

Here’s what else analysts say about Apple’s earnings report: “Simply put Apple’s results and outlook across most metrics were clearly better than expected. As a result both our and consensus estimates will move slightly higher and based on a 14.5x PE (10% discount to the market) on our slightly higher EPS estimates still result in a target price of $220 and we reiterate our Buy rating. It is no surprise that we get a lot of pushback on our Buy rating on Apple given 1) its large market cap, 2) iPhone sales have entered negative growth 3) Android has more market share and less expensive average selling points and 4) investors feel innovation at Apple has been lacking.” “AAPL’s 2Q print will help fuel the bull case for the stock with a nice beat on Rev/EPS and a 3Q Rev guide $1.5B ahead of the street at the midpoint. We believe investors will react favorably to Cook’s commentary around improvements in China demand with iPhone units potentially troughing in the Dec. quarter. Given the improved sentiment and outlook our new $210 PT implies ~16x our FY20 EPS estimate. Heading into the print there was still lingering concern about iPhone demand in China, but it appears company decisions to lower prices and offer trade-ins may ease fears. While we acknowledge that a 22% decline in China revenue is far from a resurgence, Tim Cook did highlight that iPhone declines in the last few weeks of March were significantly smaller than they were to start the quarter. The key drivers of the improved demand in China were the reduction in the VAT from 16% to 13%, the trade-in promotions, the price cuts, and improving trade relations between the US and China. These data points are all positives for Apple, but they also do little to address the question of the iPhone’s competitive positioning against the like of Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo, who have been net share gainers.” “Shares of Apple traded higher post-close as we think the company’s June quarter guide + commentary support the view that we are",error,513
2090," now seeing indications stabilizing / bottoming iPhone demand (particularly in China), coupled with continued solid double-digit growth in Apple’s services business (+16% y/y). While Greater China revenue declined 21.5% y/y in the March quarter, Apple reported that it saw better y/y iPhone performance in the last few weeks of the March quarter than the full quarter and what the company views as a trough in the months of Nov and Dec ’18. Apple reported that improved demand has been driven by: (1) Apple’s pricing actions and trade-in / financing programs, (2) China’s consumer stimulus efforts / reduction of VAT rates, and (3) improved U.S. / China trade dialogue. While Apple highlighted the success of its iPhone trade-in program, in part driven by its higher incentives, we think anticipation of a 5G iPhone in 2020 could impact upgrades. As such, we are leaving our forward estimates relatively unchanged with C2019 and C2020 at $255.9B / $11.55 and $274.6B / $13.62 vs. our prior estimate of $249.7B / $11.58 and $272.8B / $13.62. We maintain our Market Perform rating; adjust our price target to $215/sh. (15.8x P/E C2020E vs. 5-yr. median of 13.4x). We continue to have a cautious view on Apple’s Services growth sustainability over the coming quarters.” “While iPhone numbers were weaker than we had expected we were pleasantly surprised by positive trends in iPad, Wearable and Mac in both reported revenues and guidance. In guidance, we believe that new iPad Mini/Air models, Airpods and non-CPU supply constrained Macs add up to slightly better revenue even as iPhone results remain lackluster. Though in line with our above consensus expectations we point out that guided Opex implies operating margins of ~21% that have not been seen since 2008 when the iPhone was just getting started. We believe fundamentals get more challenging as the year progresses and that the stock remains toward the top of its valuation range vs. the S&P 500. We reiterate our Neutral rating.” “While “less bad” is a significant improvement from the rough start to the year, we remain Neutral as we see a long road to recovery for iPhone with a ~1yr jump in the net replacement cycle in CY19",error,513
2090," (per CSe) and further extension ahead of 5G in 2H20. Further, while we recognize the potential in the shift to Services we don’t think it’s enough to move estimates meaningfully higher over the near-to-medium term, leaving upside for the stock more dependent on the multiple re-rating higher. Against a backdrop of sizeable iPhone sales declines, we think the investor perception of Apple as a hardware-centric company will be tough to shake. With the stock trading near a peak multiple, we remain on the sidelines awaiting a better entry point and/or line-of sight to significant Services-led upside.” “Apple’s fiscal Q2 was fine. On net, we continue to see risk-reward on Apple as relatively neutral. While numbers for FY 19 are likely safe and the stock tactically tends to outperform around this time of year, we note that Apple’s valuation has already returned to its peak from last year, next year’s iPhone cycle appears uninspiring (with 5G most likely destined for introduction in Sept 2020), and this cycle’s temporary price cuts will not resolve the fundamental question circling the stock, i.e. the structural lengthening of iPhone replacement cycles.” “March Q slightly better but the real surprise was June quarter guidance. In-line with our recently raised March quarter estimates, Apple beat consensus revenue by 1% and EPS by 3% driven largely by iPhone, where we saw improving share in China and stable supply chain builds through the quarter. More importantly, June quarter guidance for a revenue decline of 8% Q/Q is materially better than historical seasonality of 13-16% Q/Q declines, and consensus view of -11% Q/Q heading into the print. Better revenue guidance speaks to the improved iPhone trajectory in the month of March which carried into April, helped by 1) iPhone pricing cuts and trade-in/financing programs, 2) stimulus in China (such as VAT tax reduction from 16% to 13%), and 3) improved consumer confidence from advancing US/China trade dialogue. Net, our FY19 and FY20 revenue and EPS estimates move slightly higher which translates to a new SoTP-based PT of $240, up from $234 previously. Apple reported a clean March quarter and bullish June quarter outlook which against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment sets up for shares to move higher.” “Looking at the remainder of FY19, we expect limited",error,513
2106," when contacted by CNBC for this report. Greater China accounts for around 17% of Apple’s net sales. In the company’s fiscal second quarter, Greater China net sales fell over 21% year-on-year. The company has faced intense competition in China from Huawei and other players like Xiaomi. It has also struggled with its pricing strategy for its latest devices in the country and retailers were forced to slash prices on some of those models earlier this year. But experts said the political tensions between the U.S. and China could end up hurting Apple further. “I think it wouldn’t take much for Beijing to flip the switch on national sentiment and really call for an outright ban,” David Riedel, president and founder of the Riedel Research Group, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday. “We have seen social media ticking up in terms of an unofficial blacklist of Apple, I think the Chinese believe they have a very good alternative in Huawei and their other homegrown and homemade handsets.” Huawei is the world’s second-largest smartphone maker in the world by market share behind Samsung. But cutting it off from key U.S. suppliers could hurt its global ambitions, experts said. While Huawei relies on American firms for its products, Apple also has a large number of Chinese suppliers. If there is disruption to the supply chain for Apple, that could hurt sales. Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys, noted that Apple has been called out before by Chinese consumers. Those times, she said, boycott activities “usually only last for a few weeks.” This time could be different, however. “Although Apple is very experienced, this time could be the toughest (the company has) ever seen and they should try everything to communicate with their loyal users on where they stand meanwhile,” Peng told CNBC, adding that the American tech giant may have to “embrace” a negative turn for its China sales in the short term. Interestingly, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei has often praised Apple. He called it a “great company” during an interview with CNBC earlier this year. In another interview on Wednesday with Chinese media, Ren also spoke of the importance of working with American firms. “In such a critical moment, I’m grateful to U.S. companies, as they’ve contributed a lot to Huawei’s development and showed their conscientiousness on",error,513

2114," Lock makes it so that a thief would not be able to access a stolen Mac. Apple is making it easier to create apps that work on macOS and iOS with Project Catalyst, which will be available to developers in the new macOS on Monday. The update means developers can easily bring their iPhone and iPad over to the Mac. It also gives Apple the opportunity to sell even more apps on the 100 million Macs being used today. Developers had been watching for signs of whether Apple’s iOS will eventually replace its operating system for Mac, or at least become the primary platform. At last year’s event, Apple said that it was not merging iOS with MacOS. But as Apple has shifted its focus into selling services to existing iPhone users as smartphone sales slim down, the mobile operating system has become increasingly more important. Apple made some of its biggest changes to the iPad’s software on Monday. It now runs a new operating system called iPad OS, which is based on iOS for iPhones. It features several new features that make the iPad act more like a traditional desktop computer. iPad OS will make it easier to multitask. Users can switch between apps more smoothly or even view two windows next to each other. That means an iPad user can put two documents or notes side by side. Typing and scrolling is designed to be easier to use as well. The keyboard can be shrunken down to make it easier to type with one hand on the screen. The new system will make it easier to share files through new folder sharing through iCloud drive. Users can also plug a thumb drive, SD card reader or digital camera directly into the iPad to upload files, videos or photos. Safari on iPad will serve viewers the desktop version of apps, rather than the mobile version to make for a smoother browsing experience. The browser will get new keyboard shortcuts and a download manager. Apple unveiled its latest version of its iPhone operating system, iOS 13. With the new system, unlocking with FaceID will be 30% faster. App launch speed will be up to twice as fast on the new system. The operating system got a big redesign with the introduction of dark mode, which gives system menus and apps a dark background. The keyboard will allow users to swipe across letters to type, rather than need to tap individual letters. Apple added new features to some of its popular iOS apps built into the iPhone. Safari will let users more easily change text size, Mail will now support rich fonts and Notes will have a gallery view. The Reminders app got the biggest rewrite",error,513
2114,", adding options to easily add photos and locations with a quick type bar. If a user tags a person in a reminder, they will get a notification about it next time they enter a message with that person. Apple has been working to revamp its Maps with more granularity and a street view mode similar to the one in Google Maps. It expects to roll out the new version of the app to the entire U.S. by the end of 2019. On the privacy front, Apple announced a new “Sign in with Apple” feature that gives users greater control over the data they share with apps. Developers will be able to include the sign-in for their apps as an alternative to a sign-in option with Facebook or Google, which Apple criticized on stage for gathering too much personal data about users. With Sign in with Apple, if an app asks a user to share their email address, the user can choose to share their real address or have Apple share an automatically generated address that forwards to their actual account. Apple also announced HomeKit Secure Video, which will analyze home security footage in the home before encrypting it and sending it to the cloud to provide better privacy. Siri is getting some new updates as well, including a more natural voice. Siri can announce messages through Apple’s messaging app or a third-party messaging app. It will also work with third-party apps like Pandora and Waze on CarPlay. Apple is making it smoother to transition audio experiences between devices, so that users can transfer music or podcasts playing through their Airpods to their HomePod once they get home. Users can also share audio with friends through their devices. Apple is bringing more apps to the watch, including voice memos, audiobooks and the calculator. The new WatchOS makes the watch more independent from the iPhone. Users will be able to update their watch software on the device directly, rather than through the iPhone. The OS will support independent apps that don’t require a companion app on the iPhone. It will also let users search the full App Store from the watch directly and live stream audio. Apple is also expanding its health features on the new watch operating system. It will give users more insights into their “activity trends” over longer periods of time. It also adds an app that will alert users when they are being exposed to dangerously loud noise levels. The company announced a new cycle tracking app for tracking fertility and menstrual cycles. The app will be available both on the watch and to nonwatch users on",error,513
2126," the manufactured world, so much of it testifies to carelessness in human activity, in engineering, in aesthetics,” he said. That’s what Ive did — sweat the little details, especially in Apple’s physical objects and how they’re manufactured, but not necessarily the strict numbers on a given iPhone’s bill of materials. “I have a problem with numbers, and I don’t really have much interest  in business,” Ive said. Before Ive, gadgets were not typically made out of aluminum shells carved out of single blocks. Laptops had tiny trackpads. Less attention was given to new case materials like stainless steel or gold alloys, which were used in the iPhone X and Apple Watch. It’s difficult to determine how much Ive’s physical designs contributed to Apple’s 20-year streak of growth, versus Apple’s software or marketing, but the look of the products was a big part of Apple’s brand. Apple products looked different than other products in stores. For example, iPods regularly came in vibrant colors and odd shapes and with new, sometimes experimental interfaces — the iPod Shuffle didn’t even have a screen. Industrial design was the first team Ive led at Apple, and it was rooted in the physical, which is why his lab is loaded with cutting-edge manufacturing equipment. People make things there. He explained his eureka moment in 2017 and how it involved creating an actual model. “I think you only really understand a material — its properties and attributes and, importantly, the opportunity the material allows — if you actually work it yourself,” Ive told Smithsonian. “And the most remarkable point in the whole process is when you make the first model. We might like it, we might not, but the first model you make, everything changes.” That’s not how Cook usually describes the magic of Apple’s process. He often falls back to a mantra centered around “only Apple,” which emphasizes how Apple controls its hardware, software and online services. “The most important things in Apple, one, a culture of innovation. This team is unbelievable in creating hardware and software and services and getting them all to work together. It just works,” Cook said in an interview with CNBC in January. Increasingly, this mantra of the whole Apple experience over the individual product is showing up in Apple",error,513
2150," rubber domes under the keys that help hold them in place and keep them sturdy. And it relied on user studies and testing to build a keyboard people liked. Finally, Apple added a physical escape key back to the MacBook Pro keyboard by shortening the “Touch Bar” at the top, which is a touchscreen that lets you access shortcuts inside apps and other things. I know. It seems silly the escape key was removed in the first place. There’s a lot more to the story here. Apple’s MacBook Pros cater to people who need a lot of power and really good screens for things like photo editing and video editing. The display is really important to those folks, so Apple made it larger while keeping the device similar size to the 15-inch MacBook Pro. That means the bezels on the side of the screen are 34% smaller than before. It’s a sharp screen, it gets nice and bright and it’s generally just gorgeous. Apple said it’s the best display in any MacBook ever. Tough to disagree. Apple added new ninth-generation Intel Core processors and upgraded the graphics to the latest AMD 5300 and 55000 chips, depending on the model you buy. Translation: That means it’s faster for stuff that artistic professionals want. Apple also increased the power while extending battery life, which is impressive. This year’s model gets 11 hours of battery life, an hour longer than last year’s MacBook Pro. It’s definitely heavy at 4.3 pounds, but only 0.3 pounds heavier than last year’s model. I prefer my less powerful MacBook Air, which is a heck of a lot lighter at 2.75 pounds. Apple is also including a faster USB-C charger that can juice up the 16-inch MacBook Pro in just 2.5 hours. That’s pretty good given the size of the battery. It means you won’t need to sit at an outlet for half a day just to get a full charge. Aside from the keyboard, my favorite feature is the new speakers. They sound better than anything I’ve ever heard out of a laptop before. I demoed them while listening to Miles Davis and loved how it felt like I was sitting inside the music, thanks to Dolby Atmos support.

2179," iPhone with cutting-edge camera technology, improved battery life and upgraded speakers, Apple has also created another fast-growth business: The wearables unit boosted sales by 50% from a year ago in the latest quarter, thanks to the popularity of the Apple Watch and AirPods. Meanwhile, Apple avoided tariffs on its core products after President Donald Trump announced this month that the U.S. had reached a “phase one” trade deal with China. That all works in favor of Apple suppliers like Qorvo, which counts on the iPhone maker for about one-third of its revenue. Chipmaker AMD provides graphics processors to some Apple iMacs and MacBook Pros. And Skyworks, which has jumped 82% this year for the ninth-best performance in the tech index, gets half its revenue selling mobile chips to Apple and its various contract manufacturers. Micron, which provides memory technology to Apple, is the 14th-best gainer in the index, up 74%. “This is an Apple world and we’re just lucky enough to live in it,” Dollarhide said. In the chip equipment market, Lam and KLA are benefiting from a trend that includes Apple but extends to the wider explosion of mobile devices. As the world prepares for 5G high-speed networks, manufacturers are developing more connected devices, which means more microprocessors. To meet that demand,  large chipmakers like Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) are boosting their spending on equipment from top suppliers. Lam and KLA had agreed to merge in 2015 in a $10.6 billion deal, but they canceled their plans amid antitrust concerns. Lam is now closing out its best year since 2003, and KLA is enjoying its biggest annual rally since 1999. “We are likely entering a decade+ expansionary period in the semiconductor industry as compute applications grow beyond PCs, phones, and tablets,” wrote Weston Twigg, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a report last month on Lam. He recommends buying the stock. “The ramp of 5G should enable more connected devices and a meaningful ramp in edge compute.” Outside of consumer gadgets, the S&P tech group has reaped the benefits of the ongoing movement to the cloud.

2182," is “thrilled to have Warren and Berkshire Hathaway as a major investor.” Cook added, “On a personal level, I’ve always greatly admired Warren and have always been grateful for his insight and advice.”  Berkshire Hathaway, through one of Buffett’s lieutenants, bought its first 10 million Apple shares in May 2016. In February 2017, Buffett, who didn’t even personally own an iPhone, told CNBC that Berkshire added almost 76 million Apple shares to its holdings the prior month. “Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product, and an enormously useful product to people that use it,” Buffett told CNBC. Buffett also said in February 2017 that he was more certain about Apple’s future than that of IBM. Five months later, he said he lost confidence in IBM. “When it got above $180 we actually sold a reasonable amount of stock,” he said at the time. About a year later, he was out of IBM completely. As of Sept. 30, 2019, Berkshire Hathaway held nearly 249 million shares of Apple. Based on Apple’s $291.52 closing share price Monday, Berkshire’s Apple stake was worth more than $72 billion. Apple stock hit an all-time, intraday high of $293.97 on Friday. On a closing basis in 2019, Apple is up a stunning 85% as of Monday, far and away the best performing component this year of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Berkshire owns all or parts of over 60 companies including Geico auto insurance, Nebraska Furniture Mart, running-shoe maker Brooks and NetJets. It also buys stocks in blue chip companies and tends to hold them over a number of years. After Apple, rounding out Berkshire’s top five holdings by market value are Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and American Express. Berkshire also has major stakes in dozens of other household names such as Kraft Heinz, J.P. Morgan Chase, General Motors and Amazon. Buffett said in the past that he admired what Jeff Bezos did with Amazon but was too late to the buy stock. Earlier this year, however, one of his lieutenants started buying Amazon, building up a stake worth nearly $1 billion based on Amazon’s $1,846.89 close on Monday.

Drivers log onto the Flex app to sign up for shifts, referred to as “blocks,” that may be for a range of Amazon services, such as Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh orders.  In the notice sent to Flex drivers, Amazon said it closed delivery locations “near the activity” and would reopen those locations when it has confirmed it is safe to do so.  “We are in close contact with local officials and will continue to monitor the protests,” the notice said. “We are proactively monitoring every zip code in the area, and are re-routing drivers to ensure that routes you take for deliveries are safe.”  Some cities also showed fewer blocks in the Flex app to accommodate citywide curfews. For example, in Miami, drivers were able to select blocks up until 7:30 p.m., ahead of the city’s 8 p.m. curfew, according to a separate document viewed by CNBC.   Target announced late Saturday that it’s temporarily closing 175 stores across the country as a result of ongoing protests.  The company, which operates 1,900 stores across the U.S., closed 71 stores in Minnesota and at least a dozen stores in California and New York. Any Target employees impacted by the store closures will be paid for up to 14 days of scheduled hours, including Covid-19 premium pay, the company said.  Employees can also work at other nearby Target locations that remain open. While many stores closed during the coronavirus outbreak, Target and other retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods kept their stores open.  Some businesses have been looted and vandalized in cities across the U.S. as protests turned violent, including a Target stores in Minneapolis and Oakland.  Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a post on Sunday that the company was supporting the more than 200 team members “displaced” by the closure at its Lake Street store in Minneapolis,” as well as at other stores “that are damaged or at risk.”  “As a Target team, we’ve huddled, we’ve consoled, we’ve witnessed horrific scenes similar to what’s playing out now and wept that not enough is changing,” Cornell said. “And as a team we’ve vowed",error,513
2215," to face pain with purpose.”  Apple announced that it would not open many of its stores on Sunday due to the protests.  “With the health and safety of our teams in mind, we’ve made the decision to keep a number of our stores in the US closed on Sunday,” the company said in a statement.  Apple has 271 stores in the U.S. and about half of those are already closed because of the pandemic. Last week, the company reopened about 100 stores in nearly 20 states across the U.S. Several Apple stores were vandalized and looted amid protests across the country, including in Minneapolis, Brooklyn and Washington, D.C.  Walmart said Sunday evening it would close hundreds of stores nationwide, the company confirmed to CNBC.  Some Walmart stores were physically damaged or looted amid protests that turned violent. On Friday, the company closed stores in Minneapolis and Atlanta. As the protests continued throughout the weekend, Walmart later moved to close stores at locations across the country, a Walmart spokesperson said.  The company is monitoring information from law enforcement, social media activity and the situation at individual stores to determine store closures, the spokesperson said. Walmart is working to determine how to support employees displaced by store closures, they added.  “We want to make sure all [our employees] are being taken care of,” the spokesperson said. “That’s been the hour by hour leading factor driving these decisions and as the situation unfolds, we’ll figure out how else to take care of them.” Walmart plans to reopen stores that were shuttered on Monday, as long as there is no physical damage at those locations and it’s determined that the surrounding area is safe, the company said. It will continue to watch the situation closely, Walmart added.  Like Target, Walmart kept its stores open during the coronavirus pandemic. However, the company reduced store hours to allow more cleaning and restocking, among other measures.  Nike is closing some of its U.S. stores that were impacted by the protests, the company confirmed to CNBC. “Nike supports free and peaceful protests and we do not condone violence,” Nike said in a statement. “We are closely following the protests occurring across the country.”  It’s unclear how many locations were closed and when Nike will reopen those stores. Looters broke into a Nike store in Manhattan during protests on Saturday evening.  Adidas is temporarily closing",error,513
2218," We’ve seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of color continue to endure discrimination and trauma. I have heard from so many that you feel afraid — afraid in your communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all, afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor, and life. At Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create technology that empowers people to change the world for the better. We’ve always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of everyone. But we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring critical resources and technology to underserved school systems. We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental injustice — like climate change — which disproportionately harm Black communities and other communities of color. We commit to looking inward and pushing progress forward on inclusion and diversity, so that every great idea can be heard. And we’re donating to organizations including the Equal Justice Initiative, which challenge racial injustice and mass incarceration. To create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored. Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines. To the Black community — we see you. You matter and your lives matter. This is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege. George Floyd’s death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a “normal” future, and build one that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice. In the words of Martin Luther King, “Every society has its protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.” With every breath we take, we must commit to being that change, and to creating a better, more just world for everyone.

Arce believes Akebia’s lead product candidate vadadustat could be efficacious in preventing lung injury in patients who experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, and protecting other organs, according to a report on July 15. However, his valuation on the company is primarily based on vadadustat’s potential US approval for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. This means that the upcoming top-line data readout in mid-2020 from the second Phase 3 pivotal program of vadadustat in non-dialysis-dependent kidney disease is the next major milestone for the stock, says the analyst. He calculates for an early 2022 launch for vadadustat with a $2.8 billion peak U.S. sales in 2030. He has a $17 stock price forecast, a 38% upside potential. Arce is ranked 265 out of over 6,750 analysts, thanks to a 17.7% average return per rating. Diversified healthcare giant UnitedHealth has just reported a large second-quarter earnings beat, while maintaining its conservative guidance. Oppenheimer’s Michael Wiederhorn reiterated his UnitedHealth buy rating with a $353 price target, up from $343 previously. UnitedHealth produced strong second-quarter results as medical costs declined precipitously due to the pandemic, the analyst explained. For instance, UnitedHealth reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $7.12, easily beating consensus of $5.28. Looking forward, UnitedHealth stuck with its fiscal-year 2020 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $16.25 to $16.55. “Since management is factoring in elevated medical costs in its 2H:20 outlook and 2021 pricing, we believe there should be upside to numbers should costs remain depressed due to the environment,” Wiederhorn wrote on July 15. As a result, the analyst told investors “we would continue to be long-term buyers.” In general, Wiederhorn believes UnitedHealth is well-positioned by virtue of its diversification, strong track record, elite management team, and exposure to certain higher growth businesses.

Top Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman has just initiated coverage on Disney, starting the House of Mouse off with a buy rating and $137 stock price forecast, a 13% upside potential. Disney is rapidly emerging as a global streaming leader, says Feldman, and ranks well ahead of peers on its direct-to-consumer video offering, Disney+. According to the Goldman analyst, the market is undervaluing Disney’s direct-to-consumer segment by a more than 50%. He sees Disney+ reaching a “conservative” 150 million subscribers by 2025 out of a total market of 721 million, and achieving profitability by 2021, versus a consensus of 2023. As Disney approaches Netflix-like scale, it will approach Netflix-like economics, says Feldman. He estimates that the market is now valuing Disney’s direct-to-consumer segment at a 50% to 60% discount to Neflix. “We believe such a material discount is unwarranted and expect this valuation gap to close as Disney+ ramps its customer base and achieves profitability,” the analyst argued. Moreover, Feldman expects that Disney’s Parks and Studios segments will fully recover post-coronavirus, adding that synergies between these two segments are also underappreciated. Feldman scores a 77% success rate and 17.1% average return on a one-year basis. Ahead of ServiceNow’s second-quarter earnings report, five-star RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin singled out the company as a top stock to watch.

In particular, he sees the IT product portfolio driving demand improvement in the quarter, with businesses seeking to optimize remote working and ensure operational resiliency.

This surge was fueled by soaring demand for Nvidia’s high-performance chips, essential for training artificial intelligence models, driving up this key performance indicator, which blew the mind of one chief investment officer.   More than 600,000 viewers tuned in for Keith Gill’s hotly anticipated appearance after a three-year absence. A 50-minute livestream featured “Roaring Kitty,” as Gill is known on YouTube, with a greenscreen image of GameStop’s live chart as the backdrop.  While Gill remains a “legend” to followers, Wall Street struggles to understand the phenomenon.   In 2001, “you had an enemy, which was the short sellers,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told “Money Movers.” “This just feels more cynical there’s no obvious enemy in this case its more of a how do we ramp up the stock.”  The enemy, however, remains Wall Street and its ecosystem.

2275," years. This ensures that the impact on Apple will be virtually nil, as it produces about $60 billion in free cash flow every year. “It’s a drop in the bucket,” Zino said. It’s also likely that Apple will use its repatriated funds to buy back shares and raise its dividend. According to Shawn Harrison, an analyst at Longbow Research, Apple currently pays out 26 percent of its free cash flow, far below the 43 percent average that its large-cap tech peers pay out. He thinks Apple will increase its dividend, but he’ll be watching on Tuesday to see if the company says anything about the pace of those dividend increases. “That’s the question,” Harrison said. “If Apple wants to be aggressive, they can double their dividend over a very short time frame, which could then help deliver a potentially high single-digit total return. But it all depends on the aggressiveness of the program.”  It’s also almost a sure bet that the company will start buying back even more of its shares. It’s already purchased 22 percent of its outstanding shares since 2012, but Zino thinks it could buy back $150 billion more. As well, the company said that it would spend $30 billion on capital expenditures in the United States over the next five years and hire 20,000 more people. Indeed, on the company’s last earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said that it will continue returning as much as it can to shareholders. “When you look at our track record of what we’ve done over the last several years, you’ve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100 percent of our free cash flow. And so that is the approach that we’re gonna be taking,” he said. The information technology sector as a whole announced $118.8 million in buybacks in 2017, while just 25 percent of tech companies have repurchased shares so far this quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. In any case, it’s going to do something with all its money, though it may not spend every dime. Apple has said it wants to get its net cash position to zero, which means it’s going to spend its money, except for what it needs to pay off its debt. And the company is $122 billion in debt, largely because it couldn’t use the",error,513
2275," money it had in Jersey to fund dividends and buybacks. Apple, though, pays ultra-low rates on its debt, which means it’s in no rush to pay it back, Zino said. So it will likely spend $163 billion — its cash and money market holdings minus its debt — and then keep the rest in U.S. bonds. When it comes to moving assets out of Jersey and into the United States, the switch should be painless, said Mitchell Goldberg, president of ClientFirst Strategy, a Melville, New York-based wealth management firm. It will likely just transfer assets from one account to another, similar to how anyone might switch bank accounts. It’s too early to say if anyone will be negatively impacted by the money move, other than the bank in Jersey, which will now have less dollars in its account, but it’s likely business will continue as usual, Goldberg said. Any investments the company might have overseas will still receive funding, while operations in the United States will operate as is, too. “It doesn’t really change anything,” Goldberg said. “Except the U.S. government will have some extra money to help it with budgeting, and Apple will have a little less money.” The clear winner in this is shareholders.

And the wearable market between the watch and headphones appears to be dominated by Apple, with no real competition. The closest competitor is Fitbit, a $1.4 billion company whose sales and market value have tanked in the past year. Apple has the wearable market all to itself right now. And, all signs point toward Apple accelerating its development in the category. There are multiple reports that Apple is exploring the creation of a pair of augmented reality glasses. While Google, and others, have failed with glasses, Apple has a proven track record of selling sexy consumer computing products. Because of the failures by Google and others, there’s a strong possibility that in five years, Apple will be owning the consumer’s face with glasses, the consumer’s wrist with the watch and the consumer’s ears with AirPods. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech industry is fighting to sell people smart speakers for their kitchen. (Which, by the way, Apple is also doing, so it’s not like it’s totally whiffing on that category!) As they fight over that market, Apple is moving to own wearables. The final piece of the Apple story is services, which is Apple’s App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay. Apple says it now has 270 million paid subscriptions, which is up 100 million on a year-over-year basis. Services delivered $9.2 billion in revenue, which was up 30 percent on a year-over-year basis. And, according to Cook, the services growth was global. He says the “minimum” growth for services was 25 percent in each geography. The services revenue is, for all intents and purposes, and ongoing tax on Apple’s users. If you own an iPhone, you probably subscribe to iCloud to expand storage. If you own an iPhone, you probably download apps and make in-app purchases. If you own an iPhone, you might even be an Apple Music subscriber. Apple doesn’t break out its margin on this business, but it would appear to be a relatively light lift for Apple, so it should be a highly profitable business since, and it should be a business that steady, and growing. So, in summary: Apple has a potentially great future business in wearables, it has an amazing",error,513
2277," market. “That’s what makes Apple’s collaboration with Hermès so interesting,” she wrote in an email to CNBC. “The two are experts in their own distinct yet complimentary fields, thereby offering the consumer the best of both technological and traditional craftsmanship. A representative from Hermès declined to speak on the record about the company’s partnership with Apple. “I think what Apple brought to the table was the idea of partnering with luxury brands that would appeal to both [tech and fashion] audiences,” said Lopez. “Having said that, I think everyone else looked at that and said I don’t want to be in the low-cost market.” Other tech companies have followed Apple’s lead in trying to use fashion to sell wearables. FitBit has partnered with designers like Vera Wang and Tory Burch to make their watches more appealing. Google’s Wear OS can be found on watches designed by brands like Kate Spade, Michael Kors and Emporio Armani. Compared to a collaboration like Kate Spade’s new touchscreen watch, which runs on Android, a fashion house’s influence on the Apple Watch can seem almost inconsequential. For designers interested in the Watch beyond its band, Apple doesn’t leave much room to play. Its consistent in-house design standards have minimized the waves the company has been able to make in the fashion world, argued Doneger’s Morrison. “You don’t hear about it, you don’t read about it,” said Morrison. “It’s not something that’s influential in how people are buying.” Despite its foray into luxury fashion, the design of the Apple Watch itself has changed very little since its introduction in 2015. The Apple Watch Series 3, the most recent model, introduced a slightly slimmer frame and a red dot on the crown button. The Apple Watch Series 4 is rumored to be released in September. As with any Apple product, it’s hard to speculate where the design might go. But trusted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has speculated to investors that the Series 4 will have a screen up to 15 percent larger and could be adding new health sensors. Lopez echoed the sentiment that doubling down on health features would allow the company to expand the products reach and partner more with health-care companies and insurers. While its fashion partnerships may have helped",error,513
2286," said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, “could very easily leak out into the world.” In an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. “We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,” he said. Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world’s smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant. The friction came into public view after the F.B.I. could not access the iPhone of a gunman who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. A federal judge ordered Apple to figure out how to open the phone, prompting Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, to respond with a blistering 1,100-word letter that said the company refused to compromise its users’ privacy. “The implications of the government’s demands are chilling,” he wrote. The two sides fought in court for a month. Then the F.B.I. abruptly announced that it had found an undisclosed group to hack into the phone, for which it paid at least $1.3 million. An inspector general’s report this year suggested the F.B.I. should have exhausted more options before it took Apple to court. Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan’s Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves. Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode.",error,513
2286," Apple blocked that technique by disabling iPhones after a certain number of wrong passcodes, but the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said. Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment. Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said. Law enforcement agencies that have purchased a GrayKey device include the Drug Enforcement Administration, which bought an advanced model this year for $30,000, according to public records. Maryland’s state police have one, as do police departments in Portland, Ore., and Rochester, Minn., according to records. Hillar Moore, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, La., said his office had paid Cellebrite thousands of dollars to unlock iPhones in five cases since 2017, including an investigation into the hazing-related death of a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University. He said the phones had yielded crucial information, and he was upset that Apple planned to close such a useful investigative avenue. “They are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,” he said. Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds — he declined to specify which — to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year. In the first 10 months of 2017, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said it had recovered and obtained warrants or consent to search 702 locked smartphones, two-thirds of which were iPhones. Smartphones running Google’s Android software have been generally easier to access, partly because many older devices lack encryption. The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple’s iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.

There is also concern that Apple could face reprisals for legal and regulatory efforts in Washington that have made it difficult for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to sell its phones and telecom equipment in the United States. Apple executives and lobbyists in Beijing and Washington, led by Mr. Cook, have been trying to work both sides. They have fostered close ties to the administration of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, an effort called Red Apple by employees at Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, after the official color of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, Mr. Cook has been pleading with the Trump White House to understand that a trade war is bad for the economy — and bad for Apple. Mr. Cook, who knows a bit of Mandarin, has attended China’s most important political events in a critical year for Mr. Xi. Days after a Chinese Communist Party congress wrote Mr. Xi’s ideas and name into the constitution, elevating him to the same status as Mao Zedong, Mr. Cook joined a small group of American and Chinese executives for a meeting where Mr. Xi lectured about innovation and reform. Later, Mr. Cook attended China’s World Internet Conference, an effort by Beijing to create a Davos-like conference for technology. There he met Wang Huning, a new member of China’s standing committee — the country’s top leadership — and an ideological force behind China’s deepening authoritarianism. In March, just after an annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp Parliament formally abolished presidential term limits, Mr. Cook attended a major summit meeting that brings together Chinese policymakers and corporate leaders. Mr. Cook has long defended Apple’s presence in China as a way to help change the country from the inside. “Each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations. And so your choice is: Do you participate, or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?” he said at a Fortune event in China in December. “You get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.” Mr. Cook has also put in time in the halls of power in Washington. Last month, he visited the White House to meet with",error,513

Mr. Cook began by applauding new corporate-tax rules and reminded Mr. Trump that Apple said it would contribute $350 billion to the American economy over the next five years, according to two people familiar with what Mr. Cook said. Then Mr. Cook switched to explaining why he thought a trade war would reverse the new tax law’s progress, the people said. Mr. Cook told the president that tariffs were effectively a tax on consumers and that the trade deficit with China is inflated because of flaws in how it is calculated, one of the people said. “He was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,” Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC shortly after the meeting. “He says Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.” Mr. Trump has also told crowds this year that Apple planned to build multiple factories in the United States. Apple has no plans to do so and has not publicly corrected him. Mr. Cook has found cabinet members more accessible in the Trump administration than the Obama administration, according to a person familiar with the talks, and he has seen eye to eye with Mr. Kudlow, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and, on some issues, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary. He has met with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, but they tend to disagree on trade issues, this person said, and he has avoided engaging with perhaps the administration’s most hawkish member on trade, Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president. Mr. Cook still sees an opening to engage on the trade issue because of disagreement inside the White House, and he doubts that a trade war — or Chinese retaliation against Apple — ultimately will happen, this person said. “He’s willing to put a brave face on and work with the Trump administration because they probably have more at stake than any other tech company when it comes to China and the tariffs,” said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and partner at the investment firm Loup Ventures.

2301," “That said, Cook does monitor the stock,” Cramer added. “More than 100 ago — May 2, 2016 — when the bears kept saying Apple’s best days were behind it, he came on this show and pretty much called the bottom.” With tech analysts constantly surveying suppliers and spooking investors with worries about Apple’s supply chain, the company’s stock has become a hub for voracious traders, jumping in and out on every report. “China worries, price points, component scares; it never ends,” Cramer said. “But that wall of worry is something that great stocks climb, and few have climbed it better than Apple.” “The law of large numbers” — the idea that a large, fast-growing organization can’t keep growing at the same pace forever — has long plagued Apple.  But Apple’s record-breaking rally bucked that theory and could pave the way for other rapid growers to trounce $1 trillion, the “Mad Money” host said. Better yet for other trillion-dollar contenders, inflation has made it so that $1 trillion isn’t what it used to be. In Cramer’s words — and to the benefit of giants like Amazon — “a trillion’s not that out of hand.” Following his ninth point, Cramer surmised that Apple wouldn’t be alone in the trillion-dollar club for long. “You’re going to start seeing  Microsoft and Amazon in the same club because of how well they’re doing,” he said. “And among these three tech titans, I have to tell you, there’s a ton of pin action.” “Here’s the bottom line: Like the iPhone X, Apple’s stock deserves to sell for what people are willing to pay for it,” the “Mad Money” host concluded. “And apparently that’s $1 trillion dollars, but, frankly, you know what? I bet it’s headed higher. Maybe a lot higher.” Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. Questions for Cramer?

2304," 100 times more cars than we did last year, so of course this is very hard work.” Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One current Tesla engineer said former co-workers who discussed the matter with him — and encouraged him to apply for jobs at Apple — were won over by the company’s leadership, competitive pay and products. Several people familiar estimated that Apple pays about one-and-a-half times the salary for technicians, software and manufacturing engineers than Tesla does today. That’s important in California’s San Francisco Bay Area, where living expenses are among the highest in the world. A former Tesla vehicle engineer who was laid off by the company in June said that stock options at Apple would probably be more attractive than they are at Tesla during a rocky time. Many employees at Tesla already sell their options as soon as they are able to in order to make up for the relatively average salaries and the high cost of living around Silicon Valley, he said. Tesla’s stock price has been under pressure, and JP Morgan predicts Tesla shares will drop from $320, where it stands now, to $195 by the year’s end. The company burned $700 million in cash in the second quarter of 2018, and is trying to reduce its capital expenditures and improve its financial health with significant debt coming due. Musk has repeatedly told investors Tesla should become profitable and cash flow positive in the second half of 2018 without raising capital beyond standard credit lines. The company is also facing repercussions of Elon Musk’s social media outbursts. After a season of lashing out at perceived critics on earnings calls and on Twitter, Musk tweeted on August 7th that he was considering taking Tesla private. He also said he had “funding secured,” and that the “only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Since then, Tesla’s stock price has declined more than 15 percent. Some Tesla veterans are leaving with a heavy heart. A former engineer who left Tesla for Apple recently said working at Tesla had been the greatest professional experience of his life. He characterized Tesla as the best company on the planet, working hard to solve problems that affect us all and future generations. Tesla’s full statement about talent competition with Apple follows: “We wish them well. Tesla is the hard path. We have 100 times less money than Apple, so of course they can afford to pay more.

2310,"ramer said Monday. The next day, Vice President Mike Pence gave a hardline speech on China at the Hudson Institute in which he cast the ongoing trade dispute as a way to curb China’s geopolitical ambitions, signaling a split in the White House between those who genuinely want a better trade deal and those who want to dismantle China’s position as a global superpower. “Between Powell’s comments and Pence’s speech, Apple’s stock got hit with a one-two punch that, frankly, until today, I [didn’t] think it was going to recover from,” Cramer said. “Even though the company reported a darned good quarter at the beginning of November, it hasn’t been able to get much traction.” Also weighing on Apple’s shares was the company’s choice to stop breaking down the quarterly sales results for its individual products, a move that many on Wall Street assumed was a sign that iPhone sales were slowing. Add to that continuing analyst downgrades and reports of slowing demand for iPhones, and not only has Apple’s stock been struggling, but so have its investors, Cramer said. “It’s very hard to have conviction in Apple when there’s so much uncertainty and the only thing we know for sure is that the company’s not going to disclose the number of iPhones it sells. I’m even hearing people fret that Apple may pre-announce to the downside because the previous guidance was too bullish,” he said. And while Cramer stood by his longtime opinion that Apple creates “the finest consumer products in history,” even he admitted that he didn’t know what will happen with its stock, which is owned by his charitable trust. “Right now, Apple, the stock, sells at a dramatic discount to the [average stock in] the ,” he said. “Analyst after analyst has slashed their price targets.” That’s because, just like with the rest of the market, “it’s hard for anyone to have conviction when there’s so much negativity,” the “Mad Money” host concluded.

2323," said in his CNBC interview. “And we’re not going to sit around waiting for the macro to change. I hope that it does and I’m actually optimistic, but we are going to focus really deeply on the things we can control.” Here’s the full letter from Cook to investors: To Apple investors: Today we are revising our guidance for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following: • Revenue of approximately $84 billion • Gross margin of approximately 38 percent • Operating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion • Other income/(expense) of approximately $550 million • Tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items We expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion. Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors: First, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4′18 — placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1′18, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1′19, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations. Second, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Third, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were",error,513
2323," constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained. Fourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. In addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I’d like to go a bit deeper on both. Emerging Market Challenges While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad. China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp. Despite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace. iPhone Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength",error,513
2323,"-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. Many Positive Results in the December Quarter While it’s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high — growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it’s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. Also, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. Services generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020. Wearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam. Finally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple’s earnings per share. Looking Ahead Our profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time. As we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. Most importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are",error,513
2325," the balance in favor of Chinese consumers adopting home-made devices rather than products like Apple,” Varathan said. Several Wall Street analysts have been cutting their iPhone production forecasts in the last few weeks amid reports of lackluster demand for the latest models. In November, Apple also said it would no longer break out iPhone sales. Then came Wednesday’s announcement, when the California-based iPhone maker  lowered guidance for fiscal first quarter revenue and gross margin, hit primarily by “economic deceleration” in Greater China. The stock, which has already plunged more than 35 percent from a record high it reached this fall, dropped more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States,” Cook said in a letter to investors. “As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,” he said. “And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.” Chinese consumers have been holding back on spending due to uncertainty about the domestic economy, but analysts say trade tensions are just one of many other factors affecting growth. The bigger question for the markets is whether tying Apple’s China struggles will tilt either administration’s hand in trade negotiations, which are set to begin in earnest early this month. As the leader of one of the largest listed companies in the U.S., Cook has also been trying to play the role of a mediator between Beijing and the White House as the two countries announced tariffs on each other in the last several months. He remained optimistic about the Chinese market in Wednesday’s letter, saying he believes Apple’s business there still has a “bright future” and the company’s services revenue has reached a record. “We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace,” he said. China’s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on whether Cook’s letter will have an impact on trade talks. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond either. Apple’s challenges will remain complex regardless of how the trade issues are resolved. “Even if one can look past the likely weakness in unit sales this cycle, there does not appear to be much new” coming in 2019",error,513
2341,"rell. This content is expected to be bundled in with Apple Music, or offered free to Apple users as a way to differentiate the iPhone from Android and other rivals.  One thing’s for sure: It’s going up against Netflix and Amazon, who will both be spending far more on content this year. With iPhone sales no longer driving growth, we’ll see how much added firepower Apple puts behind its new streaming business.  Megadeals will take a breather this year after 2018 marked massive consolidation. With Disney expected to finalize its Fox deal shortly, Comcast focused on Sky and AT&T integrating Warner Media, the new group of giants has its hands full.  Amazon, as it quickly scales its Hollywood presence, is likely to look at the remaining independent studios. But there’s no decisive need for the tech giants to buy a studio, in light of their ability to license content.  However, we could see exceptions in two key areas.  First, once Shari Redstone lands on a permanent CEO for CBS, she could push forward a merger of CBS and Viacom this year. And second, in the advertising world, look to ad agency holding companies to engage in deal making as their business gets squeezed by both consulting firms and programmatic ad platforms.  But when it comes to the smaller players media players, this year they’re likely to stick it out alone as they feel the pinch of their bigger rivals getting bigger. Discovery will double down on its niche services to lock in super fans of sports such as golf. And the companies that don’t have the scale to create a Netflix rival, as AT&T and Disney do, will increasingly focus on supplying Netflix and Amazon.  Netflix and Amazon need that content because of the transformation of Disney and Warner Bros. from suppliers into rivals this year. The corresponding pullback on licensing deals will bolster their own coffers and ability to produce more original content. Netflix will face real competition and consumers will be pushed to make tough choices.  This year, Netflix will face its first direct competition, from Disney+ and AT&T’s new service. Add to that the potential for a recession, and many consumers will start picking and choosing between the various streaming services. Will Disney+ cannibalize Netflix’s subscriber base thanks to cheaper pricing? Probably not, as the services will be quite different at first. But if the U.S. heads into recession, something has to give. Even if consumers swap the full",error,513
2341," TV bundle for a skinny offering, how many additional subscriptions can they maintain? Probably just a few. And that threat of overloaded consumers sticking with the one or two services that really provide value is what’s going to drive competition for content. And when it comes to picking and choosing, the traditional TV bundle will lose more subscribers to skinny bundles. Expect traditional carriers such as Charter, Spectrum and Dish to suffer subscriber losses from blackouts. And blackouts are only going to become more prevalent. Cable companies can’t justify paying more, especially for second-tier channels. Content companies want to either secure higher rates, or convert viewers over to their own streaming services, which provide both higher profits and valuable data. HBO’s months-long blackout on Dish Networks is ongoing, and Spectrum subscribers are still unable to access Tribune channels after a New Year’s eve blackout. There has been a lot of talk about how the studios will push to shorten the period between films’ theatrical and home video release. As it stands now, theater chains protect their ticket sales with a 90-day window before films are available at home.  Here’s the thing: Netflix is already starting to break windows on a small scale, by releasing films such as Roma and Birdbox in a handful of theaters for a few weeks. Those releases are designed to qualify for Oscars  and generate marketing buzz. But the real way Netflix is exerting pressure on those 90-day windows is by streaming original, high-budget movies, with stars such as Sandra Bullock in Birdbox, and by spending on world-wide marketing campaigns.  Traditional media giant Disney will put further pressure on that traditional 90-day window with the films it will offer exclusively on Disney+. The streaming service will feature films previously designed for theatrical release, such as a Lady and the Tramp remake and an Anna Kendrick comedy.  Disney is not technically closing any windows with these films’ streaming debuts, it’s just eliminating the window entirely by cutting the theater chains out of the equation for a new category of direct-to-consumer movie. And unlike the films Disney’s licensed to Netflix, Disney will get all the detailed information about viewers’ streaming habits.  Interestingly, Disney is one studio that is not pressuring theater chains to shorten the window protecting ticket sales. That’s because its theatrical business is thriving in this environment of fewer, bigger hits. In 2018, Disney dominated 26 percent of U.S. box office market share,",error,513
2344,". But maybe off-focus is what Apple wants if it needs to sell a growth story for investors. Salesforce sales jumped 26 percent from a year earlier in its most recent quarter. Annual revenue topped $10 billion as company sales have consistently grown more than 20 percent each year. Salesforce has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion. Apple’s current market valuation is about $700 billion. A deal would be a huge bet even for one of the world’s largest companies. Apple sales are still growing — they were up 20 percent last quarter. But the downward revenue guidance could lead to diminished growth in 2019. And Apple has recently entered some partnerships with enterprise companies, including Cisco and IBM. Apple has a history of partnering before moving on its own. It worked with Motorola in 2005 to release the Rokr E1, the first iTunes phone, before launching the iPhone in 2007. Salesforce did flirt with selling to Microsoft back in 2015. But it was a much smaller company then, with a market capitalization of about $50 billion. It’s unclear if Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff is still interested in selling, but any public company has to take an offer seriously. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all in the enterprise software business. Those companies do a lot of other things too. A departure from Apple’s core competencies might be rewarded by the market instead of shunned. Apple is going to launch a new digital video service this year, which will give its mobile device owners some free content and the right to buy subscriptions to existing media channels, similar to Amazon’s Prime Video Channels, according to people familiar with the matter. But if Apple truly wants a leg-up in original content, buying Disney would be the biggest move it could make. Of course, Disney is trying to complete a $71 billion deal of its own (though that could be $30 billion less or more after selling its Sky stake to Comcast and divesting Fox’s regional sports networks). And Disney already has an enterprise value of more than $180 billion. With a premium, that could make a deal the largest transaction of all time. Still, the ties between Apple and Disney go way back. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was on the Disney board for years and was CEO of Pixar until he sold it to Disney. Apple’s concerns about having family-friendly content for its video service jive with Disney’s brand. If AT&T was willing",error,513

CRAMER: Okay, so most tech companies, I think, don’t innovate nearly as much as you. But let me just posit what we got. You take so many risks that I don’t think you get credit for. For instance we had what turned to be ridiculous strings around our neck, and then we got the AirPods. We loved our dumb watch that told time, and now we have a smart watch that saves our lives. We loved the big, fat jack, and then we got the lightning jack. We loved our Sony, $2,000, mirrorless camera, until we got the iPhone X, which takes better pictures. Why do you, therefore, have a 12 multiple? Because to me, that is wrong. COOK: Yeah, I think it’s wrong, too. But I tell you what I focus on is the customer. And so the customers speak every quarter. They speak every year. They speak every day. And the most important thing for us is that they’re satisfied. And so when I read the emails and so forth from customers, they’re telling me how the Apple Watch has changed their life. They’re telling me how it motivated them to be more fit, be more active. They’re telling me that they discovered that they had AFib. (Atrial fibrillation.) They’re telling me they found a problem with their heart that they didn’t know existed and if they wouldn’t’ve reached out to a doctor, they might’ve died. And so these are life-changing things. We’ve got machine learning embedded in our silicon in our phone. You know, this allows us not only the power efficiency to have an incredible performance in a very small package, but it allows us to manipulate this data on the phone, have the transactions on the phone, as opposed to letting them out in the world. The whole privacy issue for — we’ve always been on the right side of privacy. But the market is now moving. And so this is an incredible strength that we’ve built. The photos that you’re able to take with your phone, as you said, I mean, these are life-changing things, if you like to chronicle your life. This morning,",error,513
2347," I picked up my phone and I saw a memory from a year ago — CRAMER: I love the memory thing. COOK: I love it, you know? I see my nephew or somebody that’s very important to you. And their face just appears. And you have a slideshow built for you. These things, they’re unbelievable. And our customers love them. And that’s the most-important thing. CRAMER: But okay, so let’s unpack that. My daughter has the 5. Why? ’Cause she loves it. She said, “Listen, Dad. If you put it in the washing machine, like your wife did, I’ll get a new one. But you can’t (COOK LAUGHS) pry it outta my cold, dead hands, ’cause I love it.” She is not an upgrader, because you made the greatest product. What do we do about that? What do you do? COOK: Well, the most important thing, for me, is that she’s happy. That is the most important thing. Now, if she’s not upgrading for another reason, maybe it’s too much of a hassle for her to upgrade. Maybe she’s worried about the transfer of data. All of this stuff, we wanna help on. And do you know, we’ve got the store that you’re in that’s very focused on having the best customer experience there, helping people set up their new phone, making sure all their data’s transferred, and also-- allowing them to trade in their current phone, which begins to look like a subsidy that the carrier may have previously provided. And it offsets some of the cost of the new phone. CRAMER: Okay, so these issues are all occurring at the same time that we do have China. You were very abject about China and the 100 percent of the upside that went away. There are issues involving perhaps, not boycotts, we know that’s off the table, but patriotism, in a strange way, meaning that, you know what? If I can get a Huawei with a subsidy, why should I buy an Apple that’s conspicuously American. How long can that last? COOK: Well, I think here’s what we saw in China in specifically. The Chinese economy, it seemed to",error,513
2347," us, began to slow, maybe, in the second half of the year. And it was on some sort of rational trajectory. We believe, based on what we saw and the timing of it, that the tension, the trade-war tension with the U.S. created this more-sharp downturn. I believe that’s temporary. Because I think that, when you really look at it, it’s in both countries’ best interests to come to an agreement. It is a complex, very complex trade agreement. And it needs to be updated. But as I’ve said before, I’m very optimistic that this will happen. And so that clearly will be good, not only for us, frankly, but I think more about the world in general. The world needs a strong U.S. and China economy for the world economy to be strong. CRAMER: My understanding is even the hardliners in the White House have moved on this issue. Now I know that President [Donald] Trump calls you a friend, I know that you go back and forth because you’re represent the greatest that we have in America. And my understanding is that there are people who feel exactly like you, which means a deal’s possible. COOK: I think a deal is very possible. And I’ve heard some very encouraging words. CRAMER: Even of recent, right? COOK: Yes, yes, very recently. And I don’t speak for them, obviously. I do talk with them. And I give them my ideas and thoughts. CRAMER: Okay, now, we gotta talk about some of these people who, the naysayers. And we’ve dealt with them before, when the stock was substantially lower. A Wedbush analyst said Apple’s clearly the darkest days, representing a challenge in growth. Journal, It’s too soon to call the XR a flop, only after a few months. But early indications are, of course, it’s a flop. What do you say to people who say XR flopped? What do you say to, say, darkest days? COOK: I say bologna. I call bologna on that. Let me tell you how I view this. Here’s the truth, what the facts are. Since we began shipping the iPhone XR, it has been the most popular iPhone every day, every",error,513
2347," single day, from when we started shipping, until now. CRAMER: But how about relatively? I mean, there’s been other ones that have — COOK: I mean, do I want to sell more? Of course I do. Of course I’d like to sell more. And we’re working on that. But in terms of the product itself, it’s an incredibly innovative product. It has a bunch of advanced technologies in it from the chip with the neural engine to security embedded to an edge-to-edge liquid retina display, the first in the industry, longest battery life ever in an iPhone. I mean, it is unbelievable. And the photos that you can take of your life and of your loved ones, I mean, it beats many, many of the standalone cameras that you could buy now that nobody uses anymore. And so these things give a lot of value to the customer. So that’s that. In terms of the naysayer, I’ve heard this over and over again, Jim. I’ve heard it in 2001. I’ve heard it in 2005 and ’07 and ‘08 and ‘10 and ‘12 and ’13. You can probably find the same quotes from the same people over and over again. And I’m not defensive on it. This is America. And you can say what you want. But I’m giving you my honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in Apple. And that culture of innovation, combined with these incredible-- loyal customers, happy customers, this ecosystem, this virtuous ecosystem, is something that is probably underappreciated. CRAMER: Well, then you were surprised with the market reaction to both when you decided to not reveal units and when you revealed the shortfall. COOK: I’m never surprised by the market, to be honest with you. Because I think the market is quite emotional in the short term. And we sorta look through all of that. We think about the long term. And so when I look at the long-term health of the company, it has never been better. The product pipeline has never been better. The ecosystem has never been stronger. The services are on a tear. If you look at, let’s just take wearables as an example, right? Wearables, it’s mainly the Apple Watch and AirPods. If you look at",error,513
2347," this, and on a trailing basis. I’m not projecting. On a trailing basis, they’ve we’ve already exceeded the revenue for wearables is already more than 50 percent more than iPod was at its peak. Now, this is a product that I think everybody would say it was an incredibly important product for Apple, full of innovation, and probably, the trigger for the company getting on a very different trajectory and into other markets. And so already, exceeded it by 50 percent at its peak. At its peak. Also, if you take AirPods and the Watch separately, and you sort of back these up and align it to the launch date of iPod, as well, and, you know, where all of them have a comparable amount of time, you would find that each one, independently, is, like, four to six times ahead of where iPod was at a comparable period of time. And so AirPods are becoming ubiquitous out there. People love them. I get notes every day. They’re chock full of tech. But they just work. It’s the elegance of them, but with significant technology and built right in and an unbelievable user interface. [Break] CRAMER: I’ve been following stocks for 40 years, Tim. And you guys are a fountain of innovation. My wife said, “Tell him, what do they want? Time travel?” (LAUGHTER) What do you have to do? COOK: Hey, time travel sounds kinda cool. CRAMER: Right? The reason I mention it is because there are companies that sell at 22 to 23 times earnings, they are the consumer packaged goods companies. There are companies that tend to go from 1 to 4 percent. If they get 5%, then they get a 28 multiple. And yet, the analysts who follow your company continue to look for units of phones, they’re not thinking about the revenue. And yet, if it were Procter & Gamble, and they got that many razor blades, they’d pay 28 times earnings. Are you followed by the wrong people? COOK: I think that our story isn’t well understood. I think Apple is not well understood in some of Wall Street. For example, I think there are several people that believe the most important metric is how many iPhones are sold in a given 90-day period or what the revenues is. This is far, far, far down my",error,513
2347," list. The point is, if somebody decides to buy an iPhone a little later, because of the battery, huge discount that we gave, they decide to hold on a little longer, I’m I’m great with that. I want the customer to be happy. We work for them. And so the important thing is that they’re happy. Because if they’re happy, they will eventually replace that product with another. And the services and the ecosystem around that will thrive. CRAMER: But as long as it’s north of 60 percent, I mean, as long as cell phones are north — I don’t know how you get people to think, even if it’s $20 billion in service revenue. It’s the 62 percent. It is overwhelming. And they don’t know what to do. And I understand their conundrum, Tim. They don’t know what to do. Because the cell phone’s such a big part of the pot. COOK: Yeah, but if you really back up and look at Apple — in our last fiscal year, we had $100 billion of revenue that was not iPhone, $100 billion. And in this last quarter, if you take everything outside of iPhone, it grew at 19 percent. Nineteen percent on a huge business. CRAMER: That’s — again, it’s a consumer packaged goods company but not a tech. Why not accept it and say, “You know what? We’re just — we wanna be covered by other people”? COOK: (LAUGH) I don’t think we get to pick who we’re covered by — CRAMER: Well, I don’t know. You’re a big company. Maybe you could. Now, I’ve got some ideas for you, okay? I talked to some people at Walmart yesterday. An arrangement with Walmart, Flipkart to take over India with a budget phone, rather than doing it piecemeal. COOK: Yeah. For us, we’re about making the best product that enriches people’s lives. And so we’re not about making the cheapest, right? We want to make a great value. But that’s not necessarily the cheapest. And so for us, what we’ve seen is there’s enough people in every country",error,513
2347," in the world that we play in that we can have a really good business by selling the best phones. Now, the best phones, we knew that, as we went to the X and then the follow-on of the XS and the XS Max, that everybody would not want to spend $1,000 for the phone. So we made the iPhone XR. And we put as many of the advanced technologies as we could in that phone-- CRAMER: Well, let Flipkart do the subsidy. COOK: And we priced it right between the 8 and the 8 Plus of the year before. But in India, in general, we are all in. It is a major focus. If you look at how we’ve done, over the years, we’ve gone from a $100, $200 million business to, last year, we exceeded $2 billion. That $2 billion was flat, year over year, after rapid, rapid growth. And so we have more work to do. We’d like to put stores there. We would like some of the duties and so forth that are put on the products to go away. And we’re working closely with the team there. And I believe that we’ll have better results at some point in the future. I’m not in the forecasting mode here today. But it’s an important market for us. CRAMER: You have people who are naysayers. One of the naysayers is not an analyst. It’s Qualcomm. Qualcomm keeps telling you, over and over again, “You’re gonna come to the table. You have to. Lost the suit in Germany. Lost the suit in China. Wait ’til you see them cave.” Are you gonna cave? COOK: No. Look, the truth is, we haven’t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I’m not sure where that thinking is coming from. The issues that we have with Qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license, no chips. This is, in our view, illegal. And so many regulators in many different countries agree with this. And then secondly, the obligation to offer their patent portfolio on a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. And they don’t do that. They charge exorbitant prices. And they",error,513
2347," have a lot of different tactics they use to do that. And that’s not just us saying that. I mean, you can see what’s coming out of the FTC trial here in the United States. And obviously, I have an issue with some of their other tactics that I’m sure you’ve read about. CRAMER: Right, that they say you are in settlement talks all the time. COOK: Well, not just that, but paying somebody to write fake news and then promoting it. This is stuff that should be beneath companies. This is not how things should operate. CRAMER: All right, so let’s talk about competition. The other company that I think of innovation I always have to talk about is Amazon. And they do great voice. You have voice. It’s a bit of a contest. If you had sort of unlimited capital, and you throw it at voice, would it make Siri even better? COOK: Well, we’re putting a ton of investment in Siri. And so if you look at Siri today, Jim, we have about a bit over 500 million devices that are using Siri out there, Siri enabled. And Siri’s used over 10 billion times a month. And it’s in 21 different languages and 30-something countries. And so we’ve tried to do we tried to create a global product. We’re not in every country yet. We want to be. And if if you want something that is something that has been created in your device, Siri is the best place to do that. I get more and more great things every day. The quality is is going up. You know voice is a never-ending journey. We all speak a bit differently. I have a southern dialect, not as southern as I used to. But there’s a lot of stuff to do there. But I’m highly confident in our ability to keep innovating like crazy there. CRAMER: Okay last question. Healthcare, if you hooked up with different — could you make it so that I can sync — I need to sync — I need the handshake with my doctor, okay? And payments, it’s gonna be huge. If you look at a PayPal, they’ve got a 30 multiple...can you layer either one of those on to be able to jump, even though it’s huge, the service stream, make it",error,513
2358," year ago, the company rolled out a service that allowed iPhone users to access their own medical records by linking up to participating hospitals. “If electronic health records are ever going to achieve their full potential, you need something to act as a universal repository for all this data, and the iPhone and Apple could easily do it,” he argued. “If Apple wants to become the universal electronic health records provider, to be the handshake between, say, the Watch’s data and the system, they’re going to need to break into this market big, and the best way to do that is by acquiring the best: Epic,” he continued. While Epic’s market capitalization isn’t public, the publicly traded Cerner has a market value of nearly $18 billion. Though, with $123 billion in cash, Apple can afford most anything, Cramer argued. Cramer preferred Epic over Cerner for its top-tier status — it’s been named the No. 1 software suite by Klas Research for eight years running — and its no-frills structure. The private company has never made an acquisition, meaning it would be easier for Apple to integrate than a giant like Cerner, he explained. Another interesting point: Epic Systems founder and CEO Judy Faulkner, who owns 43 percent of the company, is now 75 years old and has said on the record that she does not plan to bring Epic Systems to the public market. She has also reportedly created a charitable foundation to take over nearly all of her shares in Epic when her time as CEO is finished. “If she wants to retire with a bang, selling her company to Apple would be a good way to do it, especially because a deal like this one could potentially be revolutionary for the health-care sector,” Cramer said. He added that, sooner or later, the business will inevitably scale, and he’d rather have the privacy-conscious Apple control millions of health records than other tech giants. “Bottom line? With iPhone sales slowing, Apple needs to do something to jump-start its stock price and the service revenue stream,” Cramer said. “I think a big acquisition that bolsters its service business would do the job, and buying Epic Systems to double down on health care and give the handshake between [the Watch] and all of the health-care system... could do it. So, come on, [Apple CEO] Tim Cook and Judy",error,513
2361,"�s what to do: Next: Now open the Photos app on your Apple TV and sign in to iCloud. You’ll see all of the pictures you’ve snapped on your iPhone, and it’ll always be updated with the latest ones. The Apple TV supports Apple AirPlay, which lets you mirror the screen on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. It’s useful if you’re watching a YouTube video during a dinner party and want to share it with everyone on the big screen, or even if you just want to display a presentation from your Mac to your Apple TV. On an iPhone or iPad: On a Mac: Apple TV has a feature called Zero Sign-on that’s super, super useful. If you pay for cable, you don’t need to sign-in to every single premium app that’s based on a cable subscription. So, if you have TBS and CNBC installed and pay for those apps through cable, you just pick your cable network once and then those apps will sign-in automatically each time. Here’s how to set that up: Now, open an app like NBC or another network that requires cable. At some point, you or the kids might have signed up for an app that requires a monthly subscription. Maybe you don’t want to pay for it anymore. You can see and cancel those subscriptions right from your Apple TV. To do that: There are a couple of Apple TV apps that let you order food right from your TV, including GrubHub and Papa Johns pizza. To use them: I’ve been using an app called Calm recently and, as I started writing this guide, I saw that it has an Apple TV app, too. It costs $9.99 a month, but I think it’s worth it. There are a couple of other meditation apps, but to use Calm do this: You can organize the home screen of your Apple TV with folders and by moving applications around. But the controls are really hidden. To create folders or move apps around, do this: You can watch CNBC on your Apple TV. There’s a bunch of free content if you just open the app, including recent clips from your favorite shows, highlight segments from the top news of the day and more. Or, if you have a cable subscription, you can sign in and watch CNBC live. To get CNBC: You can browse for goods on Amazon and add them to a list to",error,513

That move “is when investor concerns really came to a head,” Sacconaghi wrote, especially since Netflix was widely reported to be the single highest-grossing app within the App Store in 2018. While his clients are concerned, Sacconaghi does not believe this should be a top worry. “We are not concerned - at all - about potential disintermediation of the App Store,” he wrote. Instead the analyst is worried about the iPhone and believes estimates for sale of the smart phone may need to come down more. Apple stock is down more than 13 percent over the past 12 months and down more than 27 percent in the past three. Much of that decline has followed the company’s decision to no longer break out individual sales numbers for the iPhone, iPad and Mac, a statistic analysts and investors for years used as a proxy for Apple’s financial health. Instead, CEO Tim Cook has placed his bets on the Services business, which reported revenues of $9.98 billion in the fourth quarter. “When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base,” CEO Tim Cook said on the company’s earnings call. “The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time.” Still, Apple is unlikely to be hurt much by the loss of Netflix, which as the company’s single largest developer, represented “less than 0.3 percent of total services revenue” in 2018, according to Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. What concerns Sacconaghi in the long term, though, is an ongoing lawsuit at the Supreme Court whether the “Apple Tax” meets the definition of a monopoly that has overcharged customers for apps. While the current case before the high court does not actually address the issue of whether the App Store violates antitrust law (instead, the deliberation is just determining whether the plaintiffs even have the standing to sue in the first place), if the Supreme Court rules against Apple, it means that the actual case “has only just begun,” Sacconaghi wrote.

2364," very attractive market for any supplier to consider Egypt as a hub,” Madbouli said. Sahar Nasr, Egypt’s minister of Investment and International Cooperation and a professor of Economics at the American University in Cairo, sees promising signs for foreign investment into Egypt. “We’re now in the phase of investing in human capital, education, healthcare, but also bringing more private sector participation into this sphere,” Nasr told CNBC on Tuesday. “We did the reforms when the global economy was in a better situation and when things were really flourishing, so we took these bold reforms on fiscal consolidation, monetary policies, but also improving the business environment, and the effective targeting in terms of subsidies on energy,” she said. “And that helped us a lot to bring in the private sector and achieve growth.” Egypt has seen significant macroeconomic improvement since the Arab Spring revolution and successive coups and terrorist attacks that rocked the country from 2011 onward. Structural reforms and subsidy cuts recommended by the International Monetary Fund have brought the Middle East’s most populous country its highest economic growth in a decade, and it’s now targeting 5.8 percent growth for 2019, up from 5.3 percent last year. But the cost of these austerity measures has been steep. Basic costs for Egyptians have skyrocketed while wages have stagnated. Private sector engagement will be crucial to support Egypt’s burgeoning population, currently facing unemployment of around 10 percent. Some investors remain wary of a still-tense political situation, a fragile banking sector, regional insecurity and insufficient infrastructure. Egypt nonetheless remains the top recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, with its FDI stock between 2016 and 2017 increasing from 102 to 109 billion dollars, according to Santander Trade. Egypt’s 2017 Investment Law is expected to aid FDI inflows by adding investor incentives, facilitating registration procedures, improving infrastructure and reducing the heavy red tape for which the country has long been known. Nasr described Egypt as a strategic location and a “gateway to Africa,” adding that thanks to the free trade agreements Egypt has signed with other African blocs, investors are seeing the country as a portal not simply to its domestic market of 100 million, but to a broader market of 500 million.

While clarity on the Services growth deceleration in December will also be a key focus for investors (see next paragraph), March quarter guidancewill provide a base for forecasts during the remainder of the year, and with the stock close to where it was ahead of the pre-announcement, Apple likely needs to deliver a “better than feared” revenue outlook for shares to recover further in the very near-term...

That’s where we started to see the decay begin, which metastasized into an early growth scare as we got into the late fall,” explained Veru. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Even though Apple, as a leadership stock, points toward a bearish path forward right now, it could also be a leading indicator of a broader tech turnaround. “I think, similarly, that’s been the area where we’ve seen tremendous leadership. So if we see further evidence that a dominant player like Apple is — at least, certainly the expectations are quite low — it’s really going to be what they say on the guidance.” • Since Apple has indicated that it will no longer be disclosing unit sales in its earnings reports, D.A. Davidson senior research analyst Tom Forte said he’ll be looking for a couple of different things from the company this quarter. “Given that it looks like unit sales were weak in the quarter, what are they going to tell us? For example: to what extent was it limited to the [iPhone] XR among the devices?” asked Forte. Coming up, he sees two major developments that will govern Apple’s future. “Looking ahead to the future, on a near-term basis, what does the March quarter look like, and then longer-term, what are their plans to divest away from their overexposure to the smartphone? I would argue weakness in China and weakness in iPhones is priced in, and to some extent, weakness in the March quarter is already priced in,” said Forte. So how does this affect the numbers we’ll see after the bell on Tuesday? “I think we’d have to see something really ugly out of China, or on iPhones for the stock to be under more pressure after they report earnings.” • BTIG managing director Walter Piecyk is also mostly looking past unit sales as a way to measure Apple’s quarter. “They haven’t grown iPhone units for three or four years now, so it’s not like it’s a new phenomenon that they haven’t grown units.",error,513

At the get-go, Aetna told CNBC that there will be 250,000 to 300,000 slots available, assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis. But as of the spring, employers that use Aetna as their health plan will have the option to buy additional slots for their employees. Eventually, Aetna hopes to scale out the Attain program to all of its members. Aetna’s web site claims it has 22.1 million medical members. Both companies said that the program is designed to be accessible to people with more serious health issues, including one or more chronic diseases, rather than those who are already fit and healthy. “From fitness enthusiasts, to casual gym-goers, to parents who get all their exercise by keeping up with their kids — we designed Attain for everyone,” said Alan Lotvin, executive vice president of transformation for CVS Health, in a statement. “We understand that you don’t need to be a personal trainer or work out several hours a day to be healthier.” Members can incorporate their health history and their Apple Watch data. Apple Watch currently measures users’ steps, heart rate, heart rhythm and more, and Aetna can integrate members’ claims information. Because of that, the app can recommend healthy actions to the individual, such as daily active calorie goals or to take a 10-minute walk. These recommendations to members might change over time, as the app gets smarter about each user’s needs. For instance, rather than simply recommending a flu shot, it might prompt a user to get one more urgently if there’s been an outbreak of the disease in their area. “As we learn over time, the goal is to make more customized recommendations that will help members accomplish their goals and live healthier lives,” said Apple COO Jeff Williams in a statement. Understanding that some users may be skittish about sharing personal health information, Apple and Aetna are making privacy a priority. Apple executives have often stressed that the company user privacy very seriously. In this case, members’ data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and Apple has said it will not access data that uniquely identifies an individual.

Gross margins were lower than Wall Street was expecting, a trend that could indicate that even as increased competition to the iPhone requires Apple to spend more on manufacturing better phones, there is only so much Apple can raise prices without risking the loss of customers. Sacconaghi has noted elsewhere that Apple has had to add better cameras, displays and chips, among other enhancements, and has had to give up some margin to not price itself out of the market. Apple’s services business continues to grow in size (and importance) to the company as it attempts to wean Wall Street off the iPhone sales-number obsession (it was last November when Apple shocked many investors by saying iPhone unit sales would no longer be disclosed). But services growth also decelerated year over year like the iPhone, the Bernstein analyst noted, though he added it was “still a pretty healthy number.” Apple’s total installed base of users, the key to services revenue, grew to 1.4 billion. While an 8 percent year-over-year growth rate may seem solid, Sacconaghi said it is well below the rate at which it had been growing in the past two years: 15 percent in 2016, and 12 percent to 13 percent in 2017, according to his calculations. He isn’t the only analyst worried about this deceleration. The first question on the Apple earnings call from Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty was about the installed base and services slowdown: “If you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018?” Apple CFO Luca Maestri offered plenty of answers — some easy to understand, others much more difficult to follow: “A portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we’ve made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services. The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization",error,513
2387," of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor by itself represents roughly one-third of the deceleration that you’re seeing.” The strength of the U.S. dollar also played a role, since Apple is not often repricing services based on short-term fluctuations in currency. Issues selling games on the App Store in China, a large business for Apple, took a toll, though the company expects these issues to be resolved. And its AppleCare package is seeing slower growth, Apple’s CFO said. He also noted some positives: Apple has added 100 million users in the past 12 months alone, and within its installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing “very strongly.” These issues, even if temporary, come at a time when there are other uncertainties. “There are lots of risks,” Sacconaghi told CNBC. Specifically, the trade war and the tariffs that would go into place as early as next month if the United States and China do not reach a deal. If China tries to boycott Apple or steer its citizens to Chinese products, “it can be very significant and negative” for Apple, the Bernstein analyst said. Apple has more than 40 stores in China, and it has grown to be the iPhone’s third-largest market. President Donald Trump did say this week that he is encouraged by progress in trade talks with China and thinks a deal can get done. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC this week that he was encouraged by the recent comments from both countries. But the Bernstein analyst said what got Apple to a 2018 share price and all-time high of $233 and a market valuation of $1 trillion hasn’t changed, and it isn’t buried in the margin, or services, or installed customer base numbers. “For Apple the question is, will they introduce exciting new products and services?” he said. A new iPhone is expected in September, but “expectations are pretty modest and it won’t be all that different than this year’s,” Sacconaghi said. “What drives excitement around the stock is new products,” the Bernstein analyst said, and he added that a new video content service would be the kind of idea that could help shape greater investor enthusiasm. Apple CEO Tim Cook",error,513
2399,", the maker of Angry Birds mobile games, said it actively works with partners to address infringement “for the benefit of both our player community and Rovio as a business.” Niantic, which makes Pokemon Go, said players who use pirated apps that enable cheating on its game are regularly banned for violating its terms of service. Microsoft, which owns the creative building game Minecraft, declined to comment. It is unclear how much revenue the pirate distributors are siphoning away from Apple and legitimate app makers. TutuApp offers a free version of Minecraft, which costs $6.99 in Apple’s App Store. AppValley offers a version of Spotify’s free streaming music service with the advertisements stripped away. The distributors make money by charging $13 or more per year for subscriptions to what they calls “VIP” versions of their services, which they say are more stable than the free versions. It is impossible to know how many users buy such subscriptions, but the pirate distributors combined have more than 600,000 followers on Twitter. Security researchers have long warned about the misuse of enterprise developer certificates, which act as digital keys that tell an iPhone a piece of software downloaded from the internet can be trusted and opened. They are the centerpiece of Apple’s program for corporate apps and enable consumers to install apps onto iPhones without Apple’s knowledge. Apple last month briefly banned Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet from using enterprise certificates after they used them to distribute data-gathering apps to consumers. The distributors of pirated apps seen by Reuters are using certificates obtained in the name of legitimate businesses, although it is unclear how. Several pirates have impersonated a subsidiary of China Mobile Ltd. China Mobile did not respond to requests for comment. TechCrunch earlier this week reported that certificate abuse also enabled the distribution of apps for pornography and gambling, both of which are banned from the App Store.

2428," want to hear (from doctors) about all the positives and all the negatives.” Not all the results have been published. But the researchers shared that of the approximately 419,000 people who participated in the study, about 0.5 percent received a notification about an irregular heartbeat. Stanford Medicine’s principal investigator, Mintu Turakhia, pointed to that statistic to CNBC as an “important finding,” as cardiologists have expressed concern that the Watch would produce a high rate of false positives, and send hoards of young people to the doctor’s office unnecessarily. That rate was higher with older users, at 3.2 percent, versus 0.16 percent in people between 22 and 39 years old. Of those who received a notification, not all of them followed the protocol by contacting the researchers to ask for an electrocardiogram patch to confirm the diagnosis. Only about 450 did so, which is roughly one in five. Medical experts shared a few theories on this. “It’s possible that the folks who didn’t follow through were primarily those who didn’t have really bothersome symptoms,” said Kumar Dharmarajan, a cardiologist and chief scientific officer at health insurance company Clover Health. Dharmarajan also made the point that the patch, which is worn on the chest, is not as enticing to wear as an Apple Watch, which might explain the drop-off. The latest version of the Apple Watch, the Series 4, does however include an electrocardiogram sensor on the device, which has been cleared by regulators to screen for atrial fibrillation. But cardiologists would still recommend a patch for patients to make a diagnosis and determine treatment. Another result that stood out to physicians: Of the 450 people who wore the patches, atrial fibrillation was confirmed in 34 percent of cases. So the patch agreed with the Apple Watch about one-third of the time. Bimal Shah, a cardiologist who’s also the chief medical officer of digital health company, called Livongo, described this as “moderately good for a screening tool, but not amazing.” Christopher Granger, a professor of medicine at Duke University who participated on the steering committee for the Apple Heart Study, said the result makes more sense when compared to another data point. In a smaller group of participants that wore both a patch and the Apple Watch, the likelihood that the watch detected atrial fibrillation confirmed by",error,513
2481,"’s largest total return month since 2009. “If you are worried about volatility around trade or the Fed, or people taking profits and selling, investment grade looks better than high yield and equities,” he said. But that does not mean the recent yield declines don’t have a parallel money lesson for the individual. “If you have the responsibility as a corporation or individual to refinance, you might want to,” said Joseph. Thinking like a corporate treasurer always has been a wise way for a homeowner to think about the mortgage market and, right now, all of their credit relationships. “There are certain things we can control. Refinancing debt is one of them. Hit up everyone you owe money to — the mortgage company, credit card company, consumer finance company,” said Mitch Goldberg, president of Melville, New York-based investment advisory firm ClientFirst Strategy. “That’s a surer bet than the stock and bond market if the economy slows.” For most homeowners who plan to stay in their residence for the long-term and received a mortgage in the last three years, it is worth looking at a refinance opportunity now, said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. “The most telling thing is that last time the refinance index was this high was three years ago in 2016, and that was same time that rates were similar to current levels,” he said. In November 2018, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was around 5%. While it did not move down as much as some expected based on the August action in yields, last Thursday the 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.49%. “In the April-May timeframe, maybe four million households had an incentive to refinance. At current rates it is more like 10 million households,” said Fratantoni. “If you will be in a property for a long time, and it will take six to 12 months to break even on the costs, then it almost always would be a good deal.” The general rule of thumb is that you need to be able to save at least 0.5%, because of costs — from origination to title, insurance and appraisal — as well as the cost of the individual’s time. Many homeowners already took advantage of low rates in the decade since the Great Recession ended, with multiple peaks in refinance applications. “From 2009 to 2016, it",error,513
2481," was an unending refinance wave,” Fratantoni said.  “If you’ve built up enough equity in your home and your finances are in order, now could be a great time to refinance your mortgage,” said Zillow economist Matt Speakman. But he added, “Rates are not much lower than they were a few years ago, meaning it’s likely that some people have already refinanced in recent years and are less motivated to do so again.” Refinancing activity has been heating up since earlier in the summer. But August saw a notable spike, and the Zillow economist noted that refinance activity from the past week was 152% higher than the same week last year, though that was actually a little lower than the previous few weeks’ activity. Refinance applications were up 38% in August, month-over-month, and tripled from the year-ago period. Some big Wall Street banks including Wells Fargo and Bank of America have been ramping up mortgage refinance operations. Rates could go even lower. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates again at its mid-September meeting, and the market expecting multiple cuts before the end of the year, most bond experts agree that the declining yield trend will not reverse any time soon. “The global economic uncertainty that has driven rates this low is unlikely to wane in the short term, although rates are always a threat to rebound sharply, particularly after a rally like the one we have had through most of this year,” Speakman said. Refinancing should not come down to an attempt to perfectly time rates, especial with fears of an economic slowdown and trade tensions as root causes of the decline in yields. “Conditions can change quickly and make the availability of refinancing more scarce,” Fratantoni said. “Unemployment increases and wage gains slow, and in many cases you might have credit that is not as strong as during booming times. The rates available for refinancing are for the strongest borrowers.” He said this level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets can make some people hesitate, but that can be the bigger mistake. “When rates are tanking like this people and corporations are using it as a good opportunity to clean up their balance sheet and get a better finance profile,” said Morningstar’s Joseph. “Companies lever up before markets shut down. Markets are still open and rates low.",error,513
2481,"” It is hard to imagine rates going up significantly any time in the near future, said bond strategist Khasin. “You might be able to refinance even lower, but look at what people were doing on the corporate side. They did not wait,” Khasin said, noting that the $70 billion-plus in corporate bonds issued last week occurred over a three day-period ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report. One of the key decisions in choosing to refinance debt is evaluating the cost versus other investment options. With stocks and bonds both up considerably year-to-date, the experts say it is another reason to look for alternatives outside the classic asset allocation of a market portfolio. In 2019, bonds have generated investment returns almost in line with stocks, which is atypical. The Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Index, the flagship U.S. bond benchmark, is on track for its best year since 2002. U.S. Treasurys, which are supposed to be the ultimate safe-haven asset, have generated an investment return similar to stocks. “If you were just thinking that a 50-50 portfolio would balance risk, it’s been the opposite,” Joseph said. “Rebalancing between stocks and bonds is basically not accomplishing much these days as both assets are up a lot,” Goldberg said. “With absolute value high for stocks, bonds, and gold, it is time to be more concerned with a return of your money instead of a return on your money.” He added, “It’s a matter of taking control of something that is worthwhile amidst volatile financial markets.” This past week, Mohamed El-Erian, former CEO of bond giant Pimco and current Allianz chief economic adviser, said to CNBC about the current fixed-income environment, “If you stick with the old rules, you will lose... you have to think differently about the bond market.” Speaking at a conference in Italy this past week, he added, “The bond market today is opportunistic, it is very different from the core allocation... So look for opportunistic positioning.” Corporations raking in billions in attractive bond deals is another example of the rich getting richer. Companies including Apple are issuing billions in debt to pay down older debt and for other general corporate purposes, as well as fund more stock buybacks and shareholder dividends.

2488,", the lawmakers want to learn more about how the company’s algorithm accounts for its own products and the type of data available and withheld from sellers on its marketplace. The committee also asked to see discussions related to how teams across Amazon’s various divisions, including Amazon Web Services, Amazon Marketplace and its voice product Alexa, share and use data. Lawmakers also asked for executive communications related to Amazon’s acquisitions, including Ring, PillPack and Audible. Lawmakers also want to learn more about Google’s thinking around its acquisitions of DoubleClick, YouTube, Android and others. They asked for information related to Google’s advertising business, which is also the initial focus of the probe by state attorneys general. Lawmakers asked to view discussions around Google’s calculations related to payments for ads, including ad click-through-rates. They also asked about the “prevalence of ad fraud” on its ad tech services. The committee leaders also requested information about differences in the way Google treats its own products like its browser and apps compared to those of competitors. Similar to Amazon, lawmakers also want to know how Google teams from different divisions share and use data, based on the requests in the letter. On Apple, lawmakers asked for information related to the algorithm for its App Store and how it could be modified. Developers have previously speculated that Apple favors its own apps in its App Store over those of competitors. A New York Times review of the App Store algorithm published earlier this week found Apple apps for certain searches would rank above apps from competitors, even when the Apple apps were clearly less relevant. Apple tweaked the algorithms to change that result, according to the Times, but two executives denied to the publication that the previous version of the algorithm had been a problem. They also requested to see discussions around Apple’s policies around including in-app links to outside payment systems and its revenue-share policy for in-app purchases. Apple’s payment model for app developers, commonly referred to by critics as “the Apple tax,” has been a key source of concern for companies like Spotify which has argued to European competition regulators that Apple advantages its own products through the fees. Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to a week-old blog post from the company’s senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker. “We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so,” Walker said in the post. Amazon declined to comment. Apple and Facebook",error,513
2502," administration spares Apple remains to be seen. But Trump definitely hears Cook’s requests. “Others go out and hire very expensive consultants,” Trump said in August. “Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.” Apple declined to comment for this story. It’s somewhat surprising that Cook has become the tech CEO most likely to call the president. Shortly after Trump was elected, he called the CEOs of several tech companies to meet at Trump Tower. Cook sat next to Trump and was photographed looking distinctly unhappy in pictures from that day. Cook had not been an early supporter: He hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Palo Alto in 2016, and he was on a list of possible vice presidential candidates created by her campaign, according to a leaked email published by WikiLeaks. (Cook also supported Republicans; he also hosted a fundraiser for Paul Ryan in that summer.) In a message to Apple employees, Cook explained why he showed up to talk to Trump despite supporting his opponent. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,” Cook wrote in the post published by TechCrunch. “The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena.” That’s been Cook’s guiding principle while dealing with the Trump administration. “Tim seems like the kind of a person who recognizes his company’s interest in having a seat at the table — whether or not you agree all the time,” a White House official said. Cook’s internal post included some insight into Apple’s legislative priorities, including “human rights for everyone” and “really combating climate change.” But it also touched on the top issue Apple lobbied on in 2016, according to an analysis from OpenSecrets: Taxes. “We have other things that are more business-centric — like tax reform — and something we’ve long advocated for: a simple system,” Cook wrote in the message to Apple employees. Apple achieved part of that goal in December 2017, when Trump’s tax reform enabled Apple to repatriate hundreds of billions in overseas cash at a lower tax rate, saving the company an estimated $27 billion in taxes. A month later, Apple announced that it plans to pay $38 billion in taxes — signaling that Apple was planning to repatriate nearly $250 billion in overseas cash at a 15.5% percent tax rate. Apple’s press release also said that Apple would",error,513
2502," contribute $350 billion to the US economy over the next 5 years, although it was based on a very broad definition of “contribute,” which included money that Apple had planned to spend on U.S. suppliers. Apple also gave $2,500 in restricted stock to many of its employees as a one-time tax break bonus. Trump noticed Apple’s plans, tweeting on Jan. 17, 2018: “I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!” Two weeks later, Trump used Apple’s stats in his first State of the Union speech. “Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers,” Trump said. “This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.” Later that spring, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said that Cook remarked “he loves the tax cut and tax reform” when Cook visited the White House. Cook attended a state dinner hosted by Trump in a very non-Silicon Valley tuxedo. He was joined by Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VP of environment and policy, who used to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration. The most important priority now for Apple in DC is navigating Trump’s trade war, which will start to affect Apple’s major product lines, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs on December 15 if the company doesn’t receive an exception. A tariff on Apple’s products would lead force Apple either to raise prices on products in the United States or to eat the cost itself. J.P. Morgan estimates that Apple would need to increase the price of an iPhone from $1,000 to $1,142 if the White House implements a 25% tariff on Apple’s imports, although analysts say that Apple is likely to absorb the tariff cost rather than passing it onto consumers. (Right now the iPhone would receive a 15% tariff if it does not get an exemption.) In the summer of 2018, Apple seemed confident that the iPhone would avoid tariffs. In an interview",error,513
2502," in June 2018, Cook said that “I don’t think that iPhone will get a tariff on it.” Two weeks later, the New York Times reported that confidence was the result of an assurance from the Trump administration. That summer was also when Cook laid out his feelings on tariffs. “Our view on tariffs is they show up as a tax on the consumer,” Cook said during an earnings call. The first challenge to Apple’s confidence came last fall, when the USTR finalized tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. The list, called List 3, would affect significant Apple products, including the Mac Mini, Apple Watch, and AirPods. But on September 17, one week before List 3 took effect, Apple got a tariff exemption on its Apple Watch and AirPods products. Basically, the Trump administration excluded Apple’s products from tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. List 4, first proposed by the Trump administration this spring, is poised to be even worse for Apple — the sweeping tariff list includes Apple’s crown jewel, the iPhone, which still makes up about half of Apple’s revenue. Analysts believe that Apple will apply for tariff exemptions for List 4, although the exclusion process has not started yet. Apple previously said in a letter to the government that List 4 would cover “all of Apple’s major products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, and Apple TV” and that “U.S. tariffs on Apple’s products would result in a reduction of Apple’s U.S. economic contribution.” Tariffs are part of a larger back-and-forth between Apple and the president centered on the company’s relationship with China. Apple doesn’t operate any of its own manufacturing, except for a small amount of production in Ireland. Instead, it enters into deals with contract manufacturers, who assemble Apple’s products -- nearly always in China. Changing this has been a big focus for the president. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” Trump said during a 2016 campaign rally. Trump’s focus on getting Apple to build domestically continued shortly after Cook called to congratulate him on his win in November 2016. Shortly after the election, Cook called Trump to congratulate him on his win. Trump brought up the China issue, and later said, “I",error,513
2502," got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He continued: “He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ’I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about,.” Trump repeated his claim about Apple “plants” less than a year later, in July 2017, saying that Cook “promised me three big plants — big, big, big.” The obsession with plants culminated in a game of brinksmanship this year. In June, Apple announced a new version of the Mac Pro, a low-volume, high-end computer that was previously assembled in Texas. It had not been redesigned since 2013. After the announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported that the new version was going to be assembled in China like other Macs. But in a surprise, Apple asked for tariff waivers in June on 15 different parts it needed to import — prompting Trump to tweet that “Apple will not be given Tariff waivers, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China.” As it turns out, Apple wanted to assemble the high-end, $6,000 computer in the same facility in Texas where the old Mac Pro was assembled. By the end of the week, Trump’s tone had already softened. “A man I have a lot of liking for and respect is Tim Cook, and we’ll work it out, I think they’re going to announce that they’re going to build a plant in Texas, and if they do that I’m starting to get very happy, okay,” Trump said in July. Last month, Apple announced that it planned to assemble the Mac Pro computer in Austin, Texas, after receiving tariff exemptions to import 10 of the 15 parts it needed for the Mac Pro. “We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” Cook said in a statement.

2509," achieve Google’s aims is by offering a niche product that gives access to unvarnished Google software. Partners like Samsung often add their own spin to Android to differentiate themselves, like Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant. That can get in the way of what Google’s trying to do with ambient computing. “In the process of being a software provider, and search engine, Google has earned the loyalty of millions of people, who just want to have that Google experience, taking out that bloatware that all these other vendors add,” Llamas said. Microsoft sells a lot of Surface computers: $5.7 billion worth in the year ending in June, according to a company filing. That’s at least one good reason why Microsoft released laptops and tablets, including the Surface Pro X, the Surface Laptop 3 and smart earbuds. As former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said earlier this month, “there’s plenty of profit in hardware.” But Surface is responsible for just under 5% of Microsoft’s total revenue — it makes more revenue from LinkedIn and cloud services, and it’s best known for its Windows and Office software. The world’s biggest computer manufacturers also buy Windows software to power their laptops and tablets, which sell in much greater numbers than Microsoft’s first-party hardware. Microsoft’s Surface makes up less than 5% of the tablet business worldwide, according to IDC. One reason why Microsoft invests in its Surface lineup is that it gives its partners a glimpse of where Microsoft wants to take Windows in the future. It’s a lot easier to introduce complicated new features and new designs when one company controls both its hardware and software. “With every massive shift in tech, or when that change starts to the happen, the form factor changes too, and that’s what we are starting to see here,” Panos Panay, Microsoft’s chief product officer  said earlier this week. Two hardware items announced last month underscore this point: Surface Duo and Surface Neo. Surface Neo is supposed to go on sale by the end of 2020, and it’s a double-screen folding laptop. The idea is that it can be a powerful computer you use while you walk around thanks to a totally new design. Surface Duo is a folding phone running Google’s Android, also expected to go on sale over a year in the future. It’s the",error,513
2509," latest signal that Microsoft wants to closely integrate its Windows desktop system to play well with Android smartphones. Amazon’s hardware strategy is to throw stuff into the market and see what sticks. The company also hopes that it can get users hooked on its voice assistant. At a launch event in September, it released a lot of new products, including headphones, speakers, wearables and even a pair of computer glasses. The one commonality among the products? They all can summon Alexa. That’s led Amazon to have a dominant 75% market share in smart speakers around the world. If voice interfaces continue to grow, Amazon has the advantage. “The hardware is the starting point, but Alexa is the thing that keeps you coming back,” Llamas said. “It’s not so much they’re trying to make money off of that hardware, if they are making some it’s probably not much. Instead, you’re going to be reaching for Alexa or Amazon to make that next purchase.” If an individual product doesn’t resonate with consumers, Amazon quietly ends the product line. But if it takes off, that helps Amazon’s goal of getting Alexa everywhere. “Not all companies have that luxury,” Llamas said. “It helps to be Amazon with billions, so if a product fails, the lights will still be on tomorrow.” Amazon’s hardware strategy is somewhat different from Microsoft and Google, both of which own massive computing platforms. While Amazon has released Fire tablets running on a custom version of Android, it’s never owned a gateway platform like the other tech giants. Facebook once wanted to make a phone. That project failed, leaving the company without control of the hardware and vulnerable to changes from companies like Google and Apple. So Facebook is looking for the next big platform. It’s investing in smart displays, like Facebook Portal and virtual and augmented reality. And it’s telling the world about its plans. “I’ve been saying for a while that augmented and virtual reality is going to be the next major computing platform,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at the Oculus Connect 6 conference last month. “You know, there’s only so much you can do with apps without also shaping and improving the underlying platform.” Facebook is spending real money on this project — it bought Oculus for $2 billion and it paid between $500 million",error,513
2510," Pixel 4 was able to capture really impressive pictures of stars at night using a new “Astrophotography” mode, even with lots of light pollution where I live outside New York City. I can’t wait to try it the next time I’m somewhere really dark, like on my annual vacation to Block Island. It works by taking lots of photos over the span of about three to four minutes and then uses computer smarts to combine them together. You need a tripod or something steady for it to work properly. Here’s a sample from my backyard: Like the cameras, Google’s software is another highlight. Google Assistant, the company’s competitor to Siri, is front and center. You can squeeze the Pixel 4 (like earlier versions) to bring it up whenever you want. Google Assistant can tell you the weather, read you the news, launch apps, play music and more. It’s smarter than Siri and can tap into more apps than Siri, though Apple is starting to get better. Another plus is that Google’s version of Android offers clean and quick access to all of Google’s software, from Google Docs to Gmail and Google Photos. Some other Android phones, like Samsung’s, can be cluttered with other things, like a competing (but worse) assistant named Bixby and duplicate apps. There are some exclusive apps that you can only get on a Pixel. A new voice assistant app can transcribe what you’re saying in real time, which is really awesome for journalists or others who frequently record people and have to spend hours converting the recording into written text. It worked well, transcribing whatever I said, in real time, and I was able to search back through the text for specific things I said. The Pixel 4 also has a new crash-detection function that can recognize if you’ve been in a traffic accident and automatically call 911 for you. I didn’t get in an accident during my review period, so I don’t know how well it works. It’s a neat idea, though. Google’s Pixel phones get the latest versions of Android for at least three years, which isn’t true for most Android phones. Most other phones still get monthly security updates, but one benefit to owning a Pixel is getting new features before anyone else. If you care about that, then you should get a Pixel. Google added a new face unlock feature that",error,513
2510," it says keeps the phone securely locked. There’s no fingerprint reader. You just look at the screen and it unlocks once it recognizes you, just like on an iPhone with Apple’s Face ID. It works really well, in tandem with the radar sensor that can detect your hand reaching for the phone and prepare the camera to recognize your face. It’s pretty much instantaneous, like the new iPhones. But, unlike Face ID, it works even when your eyes are closed, which means someone could take your phone and unlock it by holding it over your face while you’re sleeping. I don’t like that. The battery life was OK on my Pixel 4. It lasted through the day most times, but it drained particularly fast when I watched a lot of videos with the screen on full brightness, dropping about 20 percent after I watched “Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse” at my desk. You should buy the larger Pixel 4 XL if you want a bigger battery, but Google at least includes a fast charger in case you need to fill up quickly. Finally, the Pixel 4 has a screen that refreshes at 90hz. This doesn’t mean much to most people, but it translates into a smoother experience when scrolling through things, like Twitter or websites, and games. You can notice a difference, and phone enthusiasts often say they’d never go back to a regular 60hz refresh rate after using 90hz. While I can appreciate the smoothness, I’m not bothered returning to my iPhone or Galaxy Note 10 after using the smoother screen on a Pixel 4. I’m not wild about some of the other decisions Google made with the Pixel 4. The design is a little unappealing, with a big forehead above the screen where Google squeezed the front-facing camera, radar sensor and technology for facial recognition. It’s not as clean as the latest Samsung phones, which have just a tiny hole for the camera. I like the orange color of my review unit, though, and that Google still adds a splash of color to the power button, too. The radar sensor is a bit gimmicky right now, but that might change as Google works on it. It seems as if Google was building the so-called Soli technology and needed somewhere to use it, so decided to just cram it into a phone. It’s meant to allow you to control the Pixel 4 with gestures, but it’s super limited in",error,513
2510," what you can do. It was most valuable for detecting my hand approaching the phone and turning on the facial recognition software so that the phone unlocked quickly. You can use the Soli radar sensor to snooze or dismiss timers and alarms or skip songs in Spotify. It works if you wave your hand quickly across it, and there’s a small glowing indicator at the top of the screen to let you know it sees your hand. But it doesn’t work for anything else that might be useful, like scrolling down a website if your hands are dirty and you’re reading a recipe, or through photos. Also, this just isn’t how I use my phone. I swipe the screen. It’s fine. Google says it’s working to add more functions, but as it stands it’s pretty uninteresting. Also, Samsung first tried this sort of thing (albeit, I believe, without radar) back in 2013 with the Galaxy S4. No one cared. The Pixel 4 also doesn’t have a lot of storage or any way to expand it. The entry-level model comes with 64GB and the high-end option has 128GB. 64GB isn’t enough in an age where apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and soon Disney+ offer offline downloads. And apps and games are getting larger than ever. You should buy the 128GB model, but I’m curious why Google didn’t add expandable storage, as Samsung does. Or why it doesn’t offer 256GB or 512GB options, as Samsung and Apple do for people who need more space. My guess is Google wants you to keep as much of your stuff in its cloud storage as possible. Finally, it seems absolutely silly for Google not to include headphones in the box. Or, at the very least, an adapter so that you can use your regular headphones. The Pixel 4 doesn’t have a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, which most phones are removing these days. Google told me it made the decision because it thinks most people already have headphones. But most people who don’t use Bluetooth headphones probably don’t already have an adapter to use with the USB-C port. I like the Pixel 4, but I don’t love it. Maybe that will change as Google finds more uses for the radar sensor, which is the big thing here that’s supposed to make the Pixel stand out from the",error,513
2511," he added. “I think there’s more to the bull market than Garner gives it credit for. Still, we need her perspective.” Manufacturing conglomerate Dover has posted a series of strong quarters in 2019, which included cost cuts, Cramer said. The industrial giant found itself in rough waters with the rest of the industry as investors began to worry that the global economy was slowing down. Cramer, however, noted that the company revealed some changes in its September investor meeting. “Dover has transformed itself into a much less cyclical kind of industrial—that’s why it’s been able to rally in a tougher macroeconomic environment,” he said. “It’s why I think the stock has more upside going forward.” If StockX has plans to hold an IPO, it now has a person at the helm with experience in public markets. StockX, the Detroit-based e-commerce marketplace that started out as an exchange for limited-edition sneakers, in June brought on  alum Scott Cutler to lead the privately held company as CEO. In the same month, the company raised $110 million in a Series C funding round to give it a $1 billion valuation. The resale platform, which has expanded into other high-end products, was launched in 2016 by Josh Luber and billionaire Quicken Loans CEO Dan Gilbert. “We have world-class investors, including Dan, that are in this and I think wouldn’t that be great if we ended up with that [public] outcome, that’s certainly our objective as a company,” Cutler, who previously was a senior vice president at eBay and president of StubHub, a unit of eBay, told Cramer in a sitdown. “But we’re going after a global opportunity with consumers around the world and we’re super excited about this innovation in commerce.” It finally happened and Cramer said he’s just now noticing it. The host has been warning time and again that the 2019 class of IPOs will weigh on fast-growing stocks trading on the Nasdaq and is flagging that the cloud software stocks have felt the brunt of the pain. Cramer said it’s tricky investing in the sector here and that it’s reminiscent of unraveling of the dotcom era. “If you don’t own any of the cloud stocks, I think you’ve got to let them settle,�",error,513
2512,"’s our turn to make it all worth something. To bring together the economy we have built, the science we have uncovered, and the humanity we have received — and make the whole more meaningful than the sum of its parts. To leave something worthy of passing on. This is not an idle responsibility. We can see that in mounting storms and droughts…in vanishing species and biodiversity…in billions of people at risk of scarcity and upheaval…and in an economic system that is being called into question by activists and demagogues alike. The stakes are high, and failure is not an option. For 30 years, Ceres has been showing all of us the way forward. And I’m grateful to accept this award on Apple’s behalf and in the spirit of our unfinished work. I’m here tonight because I believe in my heart that if we are going to meet this moment, it’s our human ingenuity that is going to help us do it. We are not going to solve the challenges we face by shrinking our thinking or by pulling up the drawbridge. As tempting as it may be in moments of adversity, we can’t afford to turn away from the horizon and focus instead on defending what we’ve already got. It is our most successful, innovative and agile companies that have a responsibility to lead on climate and sustainability because they have the greatest capacity to act in a transformative way. And the converse is just as true. If you are an executive who has not developed an innovation strategy to address your impact on the climate, then you are failing in your duties as a leader. At Apple, our work on these issues is not secondary to what we do. It is not a side project or a hobby. It is an essential illustration of who we are and how we work. Before I say anything else on that — and though she couldn’t be here with us tonight — I want to recognize a leader who has done more than anyone to focus that attention, Lisa Jackson. Since she joined Apple in 2013, Lisa has revolutionized our approach to the environment — and our policy and social initiatives more broadly. Our accomplishments since, and the work that is underway right now, would not have been possible without the efforts and vision of Lisa, her team and the many others at Apple who have made the environment their life’s work. Together, Lisa and I accept nothing less than the kind of focus, creativity, quality and scale from our environmental initiatives than we do from",error,513
2512," anything else we undertake. If we can change the world with the devices we make, then we ought to be able to change the course of climate destruction worldwide. At the very least, we owe it to ourselves to try. And what we have found through these efforts is that we can add great value to our business in the process. Apple is a better, stronger, more resilient, more competitive company because of our environmental work. The same drive that gave Apple a head start in spotting entire new industries in their earliest stages has helped us see the climate crisis not as a business risk but as a problem that contains the seeds of its own solution. When we became one of the first companies to run 100% of our global operation on renewable energy, we didn’t do it just for fun. We did it because we knew it would create a virtuous cycle of demand for clean energy that brings costs down for everyone. When we announced our goal to bring 100% of our suppliers onto the clean energy grid, we didn’t do it to show off. We did it because we knew that it would provide a necessary business impulse for some of our largest partners to develop a valuable competency that sets them apart in a changing world. And because it is the right thing to do. This global effort, which just a few years ago existed only on paper, next year will bring online 6 gigawatts of new renewable power. And tonight I want to say, to the rest of our suppliers in the United States and around the world: there has never been a better time to join us, because as Dr. King said, “the time is always right to do right.” There is little to lose and an awful lot to be gained. We’ve seen similar cycles of compounding benefit in directing our innovative focus to renewable materials. To us, this has never been about setting 5 yard goals that we know we can achieve really easily and without much work, and then taking a big victory lap after we do it. Instead, in 2017 we thought hard about what we’d want to do if we could, putting all limitations, real or imagined, aside. That’s how we landed on our commitment to move toward a closed-loop supply chain and to one day stop extracting materials from the earth altogether. Now, this was pretty far out there at the time, and it still is today. We weren’t shy about saying that this wasn’t going to be something we could do overnight.",error,513
2512," But I have found that something slightly magical happens when you set goals that feel a bit crazy. The effort will take you to places you didn’t anticipate, but the results are almost always better than what you thought was possible at the outset. This one has led us to the discovery of the highest-quality 100% recycled aluminum alloy ever, which now makes up the enclosures of our flagship devices. It’s led us to build more and more essential components from 100% recycled rare earth metals. And it’s led us to disassemble, recycle and refurbish millions of iPhones per year, retaining those critical materials and redirecting them back into the supply chain. Today, our climate focus touches every aspect of our work. From the Amazon, to Colombia’s great expanses of mangroves, to the backwoods of Maine and North Carolina, we’ve preserved, restored and sometimes bought outright the best carbon recapture technology we’ve got: our forests… Since 2013, we’ve helped our suppliers conserve more than 25 billion gallons of water… And we’ve issued more than $2.5 billion in green bonds for environmental projects. Why do we do all this? Because solving problems — creatively and elegantly — is at the very heart of what makes Apple, Apple. It’s what gets every one of our employees out of bed in the morning. It keeps us curious and proud of what we do. It’s the same impulse that drives us to build the best in Accessibility features, by default, into every product we make. It’s the same drive that leads us to support and extend education’s power as a great equalizer in this country… It’s the same drive that leads us to advocate for the immigrants and Dreamers who make our work possible… And to recognize that our diverse and inclusive workforce is what is going to drive the next generation of innovation. In short, we just think that the best products in the world ought to be the best products for the world. In accepting this award, Apple commits to deepening these efforts in the years ahead. We celebrate the work and the vision of the many leaders in this room, who have spoken out and shown leadership in the years when too many were looking the other way. And we call on those beyond this room, who have great power to change the world at their fingertips, and who have so far declined to use it, to put aside pride and convenience",error,513
2518," key part of Apple’s service revenue from its App Store. Apple’s services segment, which includes products like iCloud subscriptions, as well as the wearables division, were a big driver in the tech giant’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat. Apple’s revenue from iPhones beat market expectations but still declined around 9% year-on-year for the quarter ended September. The company released its iPhone 11 range in September with an improved camera and processor. Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said that there are a large number of iPhone users waiting to upgrade, which could help Apple grow in China. “China came in well above our and Street expectations and is on the path to showing growth in the region which remains the focus of investors with this key region representing roughly 20% of all iPhone upgrades over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives said in a note on Wednesday. Apple’s iPhone 11 range accounted for 40% of its shipments in China, according to Canalys. Apple reduced the premium Chinese buyers had to pay versus the U.S. price for the new phones. Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys, said that the cheaper iPhone 11 model performed well. Despite the iPhone 11′s performance, overall shipments fell 28% during the quarter, which Peng attributed to consumers not buying older Apple smartphones. “Even the new device launch cannot offset the drops in the old device,” Peng told CNBC, adding that consumers could be holding off for a 5G iPhone, which Apple has not yet released, but could do next year. “In the next few quarter before 5G iPhones launch, Apple should expect very difficult quarters going forward because the older devices are losing interest.” Earlier this year, Apple was forced to cut the prices of its iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in China. 5G refers to next-generation mobile networks which promise super-fast data speeds. Apple’s competitors such as Samsung and Huawei have 5G smartphones on the market while China is expected to begin turning on its high-speed networks in the coming months. Meanwhile, Apple is facing increased competition from Huawei in China. The Chinese technology giant captured a record share of the country’s smartphone market in the third quarter, as shipments grew 66% from a year ago, according to Canalys. The overall Chinese smartphone market declined 3%. Huawei remains on a U.S.",error,513
2534," building.) Google and Apple say they will provide support organizations building these apps, and even provide sample apps that they can use as a starting point. But health organizations around the world vary in their technical sophistication, privacy regulations, and amount of institutional attention they can offer at the moment, and when the apps become available will likely vary by region.  Google and Apple’s APIs will become available in mid-May in software updates, the companies say. Britain’s National Health Service, among others, is already working on an app. But no release dates or launch plans have been confirmed yet.  When the apps are available, they will require testing to be readily available.  The way the proposed apps work, if someone tests positive for Covid-19, the apps will be able to use Bluetooth to figure out all the other phones that they’ve crossed paths with in the past few weeks and ping them. Cryptography will be employed to make sure that the apps can’t identify individuals on either end.  But if anyone can say that they believe they’re Covid-19 positive without independent verification, it opens the system to false notifications and other trolling. Apple and Google both confirmed that the apps will only be triggered when there’s a verified positive test. So for digital contact tracing to work, there need to be enough Covid-19 tests for anyone who believes they’re positive. In the United States, over 3 million test have been performed so far, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But officials still say there is still a lack of testing kits, and some experts say that there needs to be millions of tests done per day.  Users will actively have to participate, or “opt-in,” to use the apps and systems built with the Google and Apple technology, according to company representatives. Users will have to download an app or, later this year, consent through a pop-up to participate in helping public agencies track Covid-19 cases. Governments won’t be allowed to mandate usage, the companies say. That means everyone who participates will need to consent to share their location and proximity data.  The more people that use the system, the more effective it will be. One estimate from a contact tracing research group suggests that 60% of people in a region would need to download an app before digital contact tracing could stop the spread of the virus. Apple and Google representatives say the more people that use digital contact tracing the more effective",error,513
2534," it will be, but have not mentioned a benchmark they’re shooting for.  In technical communications, Apple and Google have made clear that the technology they’re releasing won’t give them a new database of user locations — in fact, it doesn’t use GPS location data at all — but there’s evidently still a lot of convincing to do on the privacy front, at least in the United States.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal said on Wednesday in a statement that “Apple and Google have a lot of work to do to convince a rightfully skeptical public that they are fully serious about the privacy and security of their contact tracing efforts.” President Trump praised Apple and Google’s initiative on Tuesday, but warned that it would raise “big constitutional problems” for “a lot of people.”  Digital contact tracing never been practiced at a global or national scale, and there are still questions about how well the technology works. For example, Singapore is one of the countries with an existing digital contact tracing app, although it does not use the Apple and Google protocol. But Jason Bay, one of the technologists who wrote the TraceTogether app, expressed reservations about the technology in a blog post last week, suggesting that contact tracing apps work best in conjunction with human-led interviews.  “If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under development, anywhere in the world, is ready to replace manual contact tracing, I will say without qualification that the answer is, No,” Bay wrote.  In addition, manual contact tracing is essential for demographic groups, such as minorities, that may not trust authorities or may need help navigating the medical system, said David Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition for STD Directors. “We’re not opposed to digital contact tracing. We should have done this 10 years ago, but it’s difficult to ramp this up overnight and the companies can’t just unleash all this new technology and new hires and reach people who mistrust the system,” Harvey said.  The CDC-funded group has historically done contact tracing for STDs and other infectious diseases before the Covid-19 pandemic. The majority of the group’s 1,600 “disease investigation specialists” have been redeployed to Covid-19 efforts, but the country would be smart to hire more and better utilize existing resources which already engage in contact tracing practices, Harvey said.  �",error,513
2539," during the pandemic, executives said. Apple’s more powerful computers, which include the Mac and iPad lines, could have a strong quarter as people need computers at home. “We believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter and that’s customers that are either taking online education or working remotely,” Cook said.  However, sales of mobile devices like iPhones, headphones, and Apple Watches will likely take a hit, executives said.  “On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter, relative to the March quarter,” Maestri said.  “During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13, and many channel partner sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables,” Cook said. Maestri said that people were holding onto their older iPhones for longer. “While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter which we attribute to the widespread point of sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high.” Cook said on the call he doesn’t see Apple’s customers trading down to less expensive devices with less storage or power. Other product lines likely to be hurt by the pandemic include Apple’s warranty program, AppleCare, which is often sold at stores along with new computers and phone; and Apple’s relatively small ad business, which includes search ads in the Apple App Store, ads inside the Apple News App, and “third party agreements,” Maestri said. Apple executives repeatedly talked up the company’s education and enterprise sales and software, suggesting that it sees significant opportunity as people around the world work and go to school from home. “I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely and so I suspect that trend will accelerate some,” Cook said. “I think that’s probably also true about working remotely in some areas, in some jobs.” Maestri discussed some of Apple’s enterprise clients like IBM and SAP and what they’ve done to enable work from home, including being able to manage company machines remotely and deploying new machines easily",error,513
2566," to have 100% of it, but customers would not love for Nvidia to have 100% of it,” said Sid Sheth, co-founder of aspiring rival D-Matrix. “It’s just too big of an opportunity. It would be too unhealthy if any one company took all of it.” Founded in 2019, D-Matrix plans to release a semiconductor card for servers later this year that aims to reduce the cost and latency of running AI models. The company raised $110 million in September. In addition to D-Matrix, companies ranging from multinational corporations to nascent startups are fighting for a slice of the AI chip market that could reach $400 billion in annual sales in the next five years, according to market analysts and AMD. Nvidia has generated about $80 billion in revenue over the past four quarters, and Bank of America estimates the company sold $34.5 billion in AI chips last year. Many companies taking on Nvidia’s GPUs are betting that a different architecture or certain trade-offs could produce a better chip for particular tasks. Device makers are also developing technology that could end up doing a lot of the computing for AI that’s currently taking place in large GPU-based clusters in the cloud. “Nobody can deny that today Nvidia is the hardware you want to train and run AI models,” Fernando Vidal, co-founder of 3Fourteen Research, told CNBC. “But there’s been incremental progress in leveling the playing field, from hyperscalers working on their own chips, to even little startups, designing their own silicon.” AMD CEO Lisa Su wants investors to believe there’s plenty of room for many successful companies in the space. “The key is that there are a lot of options there,” Su told reporters in December, when her company launched its most recent AI chip. “I think we’re going to see a situation where there’s not only one solution, there will be multiple solutions.” AMD makes GPUs for gaming and, like Nvidia, is adapting them for AI inside of data centers. Its flagship chip is the Instinct MI300X. Microsoft has already bought AMD processors, offering access to them through its Azure cloud. At launch, Su highlighted the chip’s excellence at inference, as opposed to competing with Nvidia for training. Last week, Microsoft said it was using AMD Instinct GPUs to serve its Copilot models. Morgan Stanley analysts took the news",error,513
2566," as a sign that AMD’s AI chip sales could surpass $4 billion this year, the company’s public target. Intel, which was surpassed by Nvidia last year in terms of revenue, is also trying to establish a presence in AI. The company recently announced the third version of its AI accelerator, Gaudi 3. This time Intel compared it directly to the competition, describing it as a more cost-effective alternative and better than Nvidia’s H100 in terms of running inference, while faster at training models. Bank of America analysts estimated recently that Intel will have less than 1% of the AI chip market this year. Intel says it has a $2 billion order of backlogs for the chip. The main roadblock to broader adoption may be software. AMD and Intel are both participating in a big industry group called the UXL foundation, which includes Google, that’s working to create free alternatives to Nvidia’s CUDA for controlling hardware for AI applications. One potential challenge for Nvidia is that it’s competing against some of its biggest customers. Cloud providers including Google, Microsoft and Amazon are all building processors for internal use. The Big Tech three, plus Oracle, make up over 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. Amazon introduced its own AI-oriented chips in 2018, under the Inferentia brand name. Inferentia is now on its second version. In 2021, Amazon Web Services debuted Tranium targeted to training. Customers can’t buy the chips but they can rent systems through AWS, which markets the chips as more cost efficient than Nvidia’s. Google is perhaps the cloud provider most committed to its own silicon. The company has been using what it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) since 2015 to train and deploy AI models. In May, Google announced the sixth version of its chip, Trillium, which the company said was used to develop its models, including Gemini and Imagen. Google also uses Nvidia chips and offers them through its cloud. Microsoft isn’t as far along. The company said last year that it was building its own AI accelerator and processor, called Maia and Cobalt. Meta isn’t a cloud provider, but the company needs massive amounts of computing power to run its software and website and to serve ads. While the Facebook parent company is buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia processors, it said in April that some of its homegrown chips were already in data centers and enabled “greater efficiency”",error,513
2566," compared to GPUs. JPMorgan analysts estimated in May that the market for building custom chips for big cloud providers could be worth as much as $30 billion, with potential growth of 20% per year. Venture capitalists see opportunities for emerging companies to jump into the game. They invested $6 billion in AI semiconductor companies in 2023, up slightly from $5.7 billion a year earlier, according to data from PitchBook. It’s a tough area for startups as semiconductors are expensive to design, develop and manufacture. But there are opportunities for differentiation. For Cerebras Systems, an AI chipmaker in Silicon Valley, the focus is on basic operations and bottlenecks for AI, versus the more general purpose nature of a GPU. The company was founded in 2015 and was valued at $4 billion during its most recent fundraising, according to Bloomberg. The Cerebras chip, WSE-2, puts GPU capabilities as well as central processing and additional memory into a single device, which is better for training large models, said CEO Andrew Feldman. “We use a giant chip, they use a lot of little chips,” Feldman said. “They’ve got challenges of moving data around, we don’t.” Feldman said his company, which counts Mayo Clinic, GlaxoSmithKline, and the U.S. Military as clients, is winning business for its supercomputing systems even going up against Nvidia. “There’s ample competition and I think that’s healthy for the ecosystem,” Feldman said. Sheth from D-Matrix said his company plans to release a card with its chiplet later this year that will allow for more computation in memory, as opposed to on a chip like a GPU. D-Matrix’s product can be slotted into an AI server along existing GPUs, but it takes work off of Nvidia chips, and helps to lower the cost of generative AI. Customers “are very receptive and very incentivized to enable a new solution to come to market,” Sheth said. The biggest threat to Nvidia’s data center business may be a change in where processing happens. Developers are increasingly betting that AI work will move from server farms to the laptops, PCs and phones we own. Big models like the ones developed by OpenAI require massive clusters of powerful GPUs for inference, but companies like Apple and Microsoft are developing “small models” that require less power and data and can",error,513
2567," take more control of how they manage their conditions instead of relying solely on doctors. Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, a start-up that makes portable electrocardiograms, said this would put patients on a more equal footing with doctors because they would have more information on their own conditions. ″It’s changing the nature of the relationship between patient and doctor,″⁣ he said, adding that doctors will no longer be ″⁣high priests.″⁣ Last month, AliveCor introduced a band for the Apple Watch with a built-in electrocardiogram, or EKG, to detect irregular heart activity such as atrial fibrillation, a form of arrhythmia and a potential cause of a stroke. AliveCor uses the watch’s heart rate monitor to alert patients to take an EKG when their pulse quickens or slows unexpectedly. The band, known as the KardiaBand, was the first Apple Watch accessory approved by the Food and Drug Administration. When a thumb is placed on the band’s sensor, EKG readings are taken in 30 seconds and sent wirelessly to the patient’s cardiologist. That helps resolve one of the biggest headaches in detecting atrial fibrillation -- catching it during an episode so a cardiologist can properly assess it. Elena Remus, 36, a digital marketing consultant from Alameda, Calif., has experienced what the KardiaBand can do. She had suffered heart palpitations on and off for the last five years, but there was little her doctors could do because they were never able to catch the incidents in real time. Shortly after buying a KardiaBand for her Apple Watch a few weeks ago, Ms. Remus felt the onset of palpitations as she was making morning coffee. She looked down at her watch and saw that her normal heart rate of around 75 beats a minute had surged to 205 beats a minute. She started taking an EKG reading on her wrist and was finally able to record the activity, allowing her doctor to diagnose her condition as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia -- or in nonmedical speak, an abnormally fast heart rhythm -- and plan a course of treatment. ″Now, I don’t feel like I’m going to pass out at home alone,″⁣ Ms. Remus said. Apple is also looking for its own medical breakthroughs. Last month, the company",error,513
2567," announced a joint research study with the Stanford University School of Medicine to see whether the Apple Watch’s heart rate sensors could detect irregular heart activity without an electrocardiogram to notify people who might be experiencing atrial fibrillation. Apple is also looking at potentially building an electrocardiogram into future models of the Apple Watch, according to a person familiar with the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential. It is unclear whether the EKG development, earlier reported by Bloomberg, would be introduced; such a product would most likely require F.D.A. clearance.

Questions and Answers Separately, Apple is continuing research on a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, according to two people with knowledge of the project. The technology is still considered to be years away, industry experts said. The current solution used by many diabetics is also coming to the Apple Watch. Dexcom, a maker of devices measuring blood sugar levels for diabetics, said it was awaiting F.D.A. approval for a continuous glucose monitor to work directly with the Apple Watch. Continuous glucose monitors use small sensors to pierce the skin to track blood sugar levels and relay those readings through a wireless transmitter. Kevin Sayer, Dexcom’s chief executive, said that patients could opt for a monitor to communicate directly with the watch for convenience, but that the big payoff could come with combining sleep or activity data from the watch with glucose readings from its device to find correlations. ″We’re just beginning to unlock the potential of that data,″⁣ Mr. Sayer said. Health care professionals said there was a risk of too much information. Dr. Khaldoun Tarakji, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Cleveland Clinic, said doctors needed to guide patients about who would benefit from more information and how much data was the right amount. ″We need to think about when too much information becomes just noise,″⁣ said Dr. Tarakji, who has worked with AliveCor to test KardiaMobile, a portable electrocardiogram that works with iPhones. A flood of information, albeit potentially useful, may overwhelm doctors instead of assisting them. Initially, KardiaMobile patients sent their doctors an email each time they took an EKG reading.

2569," 2016 on projections of fast-growing demand for electric vehicles, whose lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are also dependent on the metal. The French and German governments last year announced bans on gasoline and diesel car sales by 2040, and China is ramping up EV production. Transparency Market Research has estimated that by the end of 2022, the global automotive battery market will be worth more than $54.5 billion, up from $30 billion in 2015. So it makes sense that Apple would be looking to secure supply and potentially save a lot of money, too. This strategy could save it “hundreds of billions of dollars over the next two to three years,” Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights, told CNBC. Cobalt prices stand at $80,000 per metric ton, up from $20,000 in January 2016, and global demand for 2018 is estimated at more than 110,000 metric tons, according to Reuters. Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted last year that cobalt demand will increase 30-fold by 2030. In terms of ethical versus cost concerns, “the simple answer is a combination of both,” said Tony Southgate, head of strategic cobalt marketing at Eurasian Resources Group. “There is a concern about availability, as the EV growth is very, very rapid. Concerns over the growth of EV will impact the availability of batteries, but also buying direct from large-scale miners can ensure the material is ethically sourced.” Andries Gerbens, a trader at London-based Darton Commodities, agreed. “I’d say it’s a combination of factors. Certainly, the ethical issue has been key priority for them, and it has proven quite difficult to obtain good supply-chain visibility in the case of cobalt,” he said. “It certainly does remove that element of uncertainty.” “Meanwhile, security of supply has definitely been a major concern for [Apple],” Gerbens added. “Everyone agrees that cobalt is likely to be in deficit in the coming years, and for a company like Apple, lithium-ion batteries are key, and therefore security of supply of the raw materials going into those batteries is crucial.” While Gerbens did not foresee an immediate impact on market prices, what this potential move would do is “further strengthen the bullish sentiment that’s already seen in cobalt today and has been",error,513
2576," Japan Display, which gets 54 percent of sales from Apple, has become the latest to field questions from investors about whether it has been “shut out of Apple’s fortunes,” alongside Dialog Semiconductor (74 percent of revenue comes from Apple). Speaking generally about Apple’s hardware suppliers, here’s what former Apple engineer Bruce Tognazzini told CNBC this week: “What Apple does — and it’s a very deliberate strategy — is they line up enough components so that no matter how much sales run away, they are not going to run out of parts. And then, when they get to the point where they have a clearer picture of what the maximum number of sales will be, they cut back on their orders. This not only ensures they always have the parts they need, but it also ties up production capacity and keeps these companies from offering that capacity to other cell phone companies. So it’s kind of a double win for them.” It’s not just smaller companies. Chipmaker Qualcomm gets 10 percent of revenue from Apple.  After working harmoniously together for years, the two companies are in the midst of an exhaustive legal dispute over royalty payments, patents and contracts. Qualcomm has many reasons to be concerned, including this one: As of Friday, Counterpoint Research estimates that Apple is now the top global smartphone system-on-a-chip provider — second only to Qualcomm. Qualcomm declined to comment and Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment. Hardware companies aren’t alone in tying their fortunes to Apple. Mobile game developers don’t have many places to go for distribution, with Apple and Google having largely cornered the market. Apart from collaborations like Super Mario and Swift Playgrounds, Apple doesn’t stamp its name on too many games, turning instead to third-party developers to supply the entertainment that fills the App Store. There’s plenty of money to be made. On Christmas day alone, consumers spent $158 million on mobile games, according to data from Sensor Tower. But gaming is also a hit-driven industry, fueled by fads like FarmVille, Pokemon Go and Flappy Bird. GungHo Online Entertainment, which gets 54 percent of its revenue from Apple, is a prime example of the risk.

However, with IP, with innovation, you need to have IP protection.” But IP protection comes at a price. For Cypress Semiconductor, which boasts high-profile clients like Amazon, Sonos and Nintendo, that price is 1.5 percent of its revenue. “It’s not material. Obviously, we’re always monitoring the situation,” he told Cramer. “We’re heavily involved with the respective parties. We’re working on ways to minimize even that little 1.5 percent that we have. That’s direct impact for Cypress.

2597," library of original television programming tied to some of the biggest names in entertainment and media like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Reese Witherspoon. It also recently bought a company called Texture, the so-called “Netflix of magazines” that provides access to several popular periodicals for a monthly subscription. Although Apple hasn’t said how it plans to sell all this new content, it’s already putting all the pieces in place to squeeze even more money out of each iPhone owner through subscriptions. Apple’s “Other Products” category, which includes accessories like the Apple Watch, HomePod and AirPods, is another promising area of growth for Apple. That category booked $3.74 billion in revenue last quarter, up 30 percent from the year-ago quarter. Apple doesn’t break out individual sales of each product in the category, but it appears a lot of the growth was fueled by the Apple Watch, which CEO Tim Cook said grew “in the mid-40 percent range” for the quarter. Apple is continuing to add features to the Watch, particularly around letting customers track and manage their health. Meanwhile, the HomePod, which launched earlier this year, is just getting started. And a new report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates the $349 speaker is showing signs that it can catch up to Amazon’s four-year head start with the Amazon Echo by doubling its market share in the smart speaker category to 6 percent. Apple also has laid the groundwork for a bigger play in home automation with HomeKit, which lets iOS devices control and interact with other home devices. There are more accessories coming. Bloomberg reports Apple is planning a high-end pair of over-the-ear, wireless headphones and new AirPods with noise cancellation that could launch in 2019. Apple has a history of creating new hardware products that cannibalize its current lineup, and at some point it will probably do the same with the iPhone. It’s already laying the groundwork for the next big thing after the iPhone through its augmented reality (AR) developer kit, which lets developers create apps for the iPhone and iPad that overlay computer-generated images on top of the real world. Apple hasn’t been shy about its bullishness on AR, and by starting a vibrant developer ecosystem now, it puts itself in a good position to have plenty of AR apps ready to go if it decides to release some sort of futuristic AR glasses, as it has reportedly been developing.

2601," administrator, were getting close to the threshold of being banned from the site due to repeated violations. The company explained on Monday that when it deletes content, the removal counts as a strike — essentially a warning — against the person that uploaded it. In the case of pages, Facebook said it holds both a page and an administrator who posts content in violation of its rules accountable. But it also said that the reason for removing Jones’ pages was in no way related to concerns over fake news. “All four pages have been unpublished for repeated violations of Community Standards and accumulating too many strikes,” the company said in a blog post. “While much of the discussion around Infowars has been related to false news, which is a serious issue that we are working to address by demoting links marked wrong by fact checkers and suggesting additional content, none of the violations that spurred today’s removals were related to this.” Facebook in particular has faced calls to remove Jones from the platform altogether. Last month, the company was asked by a CNN journalist why it had not banned InfoWars completely, given its aim to crack down on fake news. Facebook — along with CEO Mark Zuckerberg — defended the decision not to remove InfoWars. Tech giants have faced calls from both sides of the political spectrum to be more transparent about the way they approach content flagging and banning. On the left, there are critics who say these firms are not doing enough to take down harmful and offensive content, while on the right there are some who think internet firms are routinely censoring conservative posts. As private companies, there is nothing in law to bar them from removing user-generated videos and audio as they see fit. But a number of mostly conservative commentators have framed the issue as a matter of freedom of speech. YouTube removed Jones’ official channel later Monday morning. “All users agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines when they sign up to use YouTube,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “When users violate these policies repeatedly, like our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures, we terminate their accounts.” Jones publishes many of the same videos that violated Facebook’s policies to YouTube. YouTube has taken action against Jones in the past, including removing some of his videos. He was barred from live streaming for violating YouTube policies, but continued to live stream on other channels, according to YouTube. His actions led the company to remove his",error,513

Pinterest removed the official InfoWars board on Monday afternoon after multiple people alerted the company to policy violations. “Consistent with our existing policies, we take action against accounts that repeatedly save content that could lead to harm,” a Pinterest spokesperson said. “People come to Pinterest to discover ideas for their lives, and we continue to enforce our principles to maintain a safe, useful and inspiring experience for our users.” Spotify last week pulled several of Jones’ podcast episodes, citing the violation of its policies on hateful content. On Monday, however, the streaming service completely removed “The Alex Jones Show” from the platform, a spokesperson for the company told CNBC. Spotify continued to review the podcast over the weekend and arrived at the conclusion that enough of it went against its code on hateful content to warrant a complete deletion of the show. Spotify’s policies mean that more than one contravention can result in a podcast creator being barred from the platform altogether. The company had been confronted with the threat of some users leaving the platform for not being tough enough on the right-wing online personality. Jones responded to the bans Monday in a series of tweets and a live stream on Periscope, which is owned by Twitter. His accounts for both platforms remained up and active through the day. Twitter takes action on content that is flagged for abuse or other violations of company policy, the company told CNBC, but InfoWars and its associated accounts had yet to violate the guidelines for either platform. Those accounts will remain active for now. The problem of online political content as a whole has proven to be a contentious one for digital companies. Two weeks ago, Facebook faced the biggest one-day market rout in history, shedding more than $100 billion from its market value in the space of just one trading day. That followed concerns that the company’s data scandal, in which the data of 87 million users were shared improperly with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, had affected second-quarter revenues. Issues around data privacy and fake news have become almost intertwined as politicians and regulators examine how to deal with claims that digital platforms were used as a tool to influence major elections including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the U.K. Brexit referendum. Therefore, tech firms have been at the center of the debacle, with analysts questioning whether they could be the target of increased regulation.

2611,"’t think Apple is going to do that. There needs to be a hardware sacrifice to justify the lower price. I’m just not sure where. It’s possible Apple moves its $1,599 Core i5 MacBook down to the $1,299 price that the entry-level costs, and then eliminates the Core i5 chip from the entry-level MacBook Air and moves to a lower-powered Core m3 chip At least in that situation, the MacBook would remain the better computer at $1,299 and there would be room for a $999 MacBook Air with a Retina display. I hope it adds multiple USB-C ports, too. Bloomberg didn’t provide any information on what Apple will include in the so-called Mac Mini Pro. Apple hasn’t ever offered a “pro” version of this computer — a small box that doesn’t ship with a display — but I think there’s demand for one. Oddly, Apple hasn’t updated the Mac Mini since 2014, but still sells it for $499. Bloomberg said the new model will cost more because of bumps in processor and storage options. A “pro” computer should have at least Intel’s latest eighth generation Intel Core i5 chip, or even the more powerful Core i7 model. The current Mac Mini still relies on older 5,400 rpm hard drives on the lower end, too, so Apple will likely bump up to faster solid-state hard drives, but maybe at the cost of storage space. (Expect 128GB in the entry-level model instead of 500GB, for example.) I suspect Apple will also upgrade to Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, which are newer and used in its other computers and would allow the computer to support several 4K displays at once. This is speculation based off of what Apple includes in its MacBook Pro laptops, and might make sense since the Mac Mini is small and doesn’t have a lot of room for more advanced hardware, like high-end graphics cards, which you find in larger computers like the iMac Pro. Confusing things even more, Apple has said it plans to launch a new, high-end Mac Pro desktop in 2019. That’s different than the Mac Mini Pro. So it’s unclear what Apple will do to set those two devices apart. Apple tends to launch new Macs in the fall, so it’s likely we’ll hear a formal",error,513
2622," users (“abnormal” or “normal”, for instance). AliveCor did that, so we know it’s possible. As Gundotra recalls, the FDA approved both the algorithms and the hardware at the same time. It’s not clear how Apple would design an ECG — there are a variety of different options, including a watch band sensor that could be similar in style to the AliveCor product, the KardiaBand. The company could also build it into the watch itself using the button on the side and sensors on the bottom of the device. Potentially millions of people. If Apple gets the watch approved as a medical device, one of the first uses would be to screen for Atrial Fibrillation (“AFib”), a heart rhythm disorder and a common cause of stroke. We already know that Apple wants to help people at risk for the condition, which kills more some 130,000 people in the United States alone. It developed a Heart Study app in 2017 to pickup on potential problems in a general population. Those who enrolled for the study and were deemed at risk were sent a patch from a third-party medical device company to perform an EGG, which is the gold standard test for diagnosing the condition. So for Apple, building its own makes sense. Why not just point a user to the ECG sensor on the Apple Watch instead? That move could bring its Apple Watch to an older demographic of users. People over the age of 65 have an elevated risk of AFib, and they might opt to get a smartwatch with an ECG for peace of mind alone. If Apple wants to use an ECG to screen for and diagnose disease, it will need to convince doctors first. Clinicians are a naturally skeptical bunch, and they might be concerned about swarms of healthy people bringing Apple Watch data to their office without much context. Apple will need to prove to this community in particular that it won’t have a high rate of false positives (people who think they have a condition when they don’t) and false negatives (people who think they’re fine when they’re not). Doctors might also be concerned about the potential liability if users blame them for failing to see signal in the noise. Another question for those that get a positive result: What will be the next step for a user who gets an abnormal result, but doesn’t have a doctor nearby? And will Apple be responsible for these users? Adding",error,513
2635,", Amazon instead was characterized as a witness. Amazon declined to comment. However, the company flagged information about its anti-counterfeiting efforts on its website. Apple declined an interview about the lawsuit and instead issued a statement: “The safety of our customers is our first priority, and our teams are constantly working with law enforcement, resellers and e-commerce sites around the world to remove counterfeit products from the market.” Along with the safety hazards they pose, knockoffs also inflict economic damage. Counterfeit products, software piracy and theft of trade secrets take as much as a $600 billion annual bite out of the U.S. economy, according to a 2017 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a private watchdog group. Using records supplied by Amazon, Apple traced the origin of the counterfeit electronics identified in the lawsuit to Hong Kong. The company declined to identify the manufacturer based there. More than 90 percent of all counterfeit products offered for sale in the U.S. originate in China or Hong Kong, said Craig Crosby, publisher of The Counterfeit Report, an industry- and corporate-backed website that alerts consumers to fake products. China and Hong Kong ranked first and second, respectively, as the origin for all annual product seizures by federal investigators since 2009 because the items infringed on U.S. trademarks or copyrights, or were subject to exclusion orders. The first U.S. stop for the Apple counterfeits was Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood, a quiet section of single and multifamily homes near the elevated D Train subway above New Utrecht Avenue. The area is home to approximately 200,000 people. Many are part of the area’s strictly Orthodox Jewish community, families who come and go to work, school, shopping, yeshivas and synagogues. There’s no outward sign of an import company – or any business – at an attached residential building on 59th Street. Two of the neatly kept structure’s floors have front balconies.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection investigators alerted Apple to at least 58 seizures during a roughly one-year time frame for suspected counterfeit products imported to the companies’ shared Brooklyn address, court records show. The equipment included more than 19,000 fake Apple EarPods, MagSafe power adapters, USB power adapters and Lightning cables. Customs and Border Protection declined to discuss seizures of products that copied specific companies’ electronics, citing legal restrictions. Starkeys, incorporated in 2012, and SATK, formed four years later, also share a mailing address on 53rd Street, roughly six blocks away. The location is a small first-floor commercial location that houses a bustling Mr. Mailman center with postal supplies and mailboxes. In court responses to the lawsuit, the companies denied “having sold counterfeit or infringing Apple products” but acknowledged that Kohn is their owner. Naomi Gray, an attorney for the companies, did not respond to emailed questions. USA TODAY interviews in the area near the companies’ locations found no one who had heard about the firms, or about Apple’s allegations. However, Rico Infantino, a 48-year-old Brooklyn resident, said locations selling counterfeit electronic accessories are “commonplace” across New York City. “In Manhattan, every street corner you see someone selling, I guess it’s called knockoff Apple equipment or Samsung equipment, or LG,” Infantino said. Starkeys and SATK imports of alleged Apple counterfeits that were not seized by customs made it into the U.S. and went to the Edison, New Jersey, warehouse of DGL Group, the companies’ “sole customer” for the products, Apple alleged. Brooklyn-founded in 2001, DGL has offices in Edison, New Jersey, and Shenzhen, China, the company website says. The company is headed by Ezra Zaafarani, a resident of Brooklyn’s Sheepshead Bay neighborhood, business records show. Apple alleged that DGL was “a repeat infringer” of its intellectual property. The company sold unauthorized copies of Apple power adapters and cables in 2014 and subsequently agreed to avoid subsequent infringement after the tech giant discovered the counterfeits, Apple said. Starkeys and SATK “exist to facilitate DGL’s acquisition of Apple-branded products from China and/or Hong Kong – products which have every indicia of being counterfeit,” Apple alleged in its",error,513
2635," amended court complaint. DGL’s website says the company focuses on consumer electronics and has an import-export division that can “meet retailers’ needs in consumer electronics through our own brands.” DGL also boasts a toy division and lists brand partners that include Disney’s Pixar division, Coca-Cola, and Crayola. Those companies did not respond to messages seeking comment on the business relationships. DGL and the company’s attorney, Andrew Levine, did not respond to messages seeking comment. The company has been the target of other infringement lawsuits. In 2015, Florida-based Battery on the Go, a producer of portable battery chargers for smartphones, accused DGL of using its PowerBar trademark “to market and sell their own, albeit low quality, and dangerous, portable battery chargers.” DGL denied any infringement violations in a counterclaim that asked a federal judge to dismiss the Florida company’s allegations. The legal battle ended with a confidential settlement agreement in June. Alejandro Brito, the attorney who represented Battery on the Go, did not respond to a phone message asking whether the company continued to see DGL offering suspected knockoffs of its products. California-based company Cloud B accused DGL of trademark and copyright infringement in 2014 for marketing “Starlight Turtle” toys that were “confusingly similar” to its Twilight Turtle toys. DGL agreed to a permanent injunction that restrained the company from marketing designs “substantially similar” to those owned by Cloud B. Cloud B did not respond to an email asking whether the company continued to find any DGL-made knockoffs of its products. DGL sold counterfeit Apple products to Mobile Star, an electronic equipment company based in Metuchen, New Jersey, Apple alleged. Along with being part of the import trail that brought counterfeits to Amazon, Mobile Star also sold Apple knockoffs to Groupon, an e-commerce marketplace, and to an Apple investigator, the tech giant charged. Referring to the preceding stops in the counterfeit trail, Apple said legal discovery in the lawsuit “revealed that Mobile Star’s supply chain includes entities that are known counterfeiters and infringers of Apple’s intellectual property and source large quantities of Apple-branded products directly from entities based in China.” Founded in New York in 2008, Mobile Star is headed by Brooklyn businessman Jack Braha.

Well, Adobe was a big part of the reason.” In Adobe’s annual conference on Tuesday, the company forecast a $108 billion total addressable market by 2021 and 20 percent revenue growth. The updates sent shares of Adobe up 10 percent. “But, of course, this market has the memory of a gnat, so Adobe’s stock got slammed along with everything else today,” Cramer said. “I think you need to view that weakness as an opportunity because we know how well they’re doing.” The ubiquitous Microsoft took fourth place in Cramer’s  ranking.

I once bought and returned the smaller MacBook, because it comes with a less powerful processor that became sluggish when I had too many browser tabs and apps open. The MacBook Air doesn’t have that issue. However, if you want to do professional video editing, you may want to consider Apple’s MacBook Pros, which have more muscle under the hood. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the side, which is plenty, and they work overtime to support all sorts of things, from a 5K display to fast external storage and even the MacBook’s charger. If you’re using it for work, you might want to consider a dock that has a few more ports for older USB keys or a keyboard and mouse, without the need for adapters. Here’s the thing though: Aside from perhaps wanting to connect a display, I really never found a need to connect anything else. I don’t really use USB keys anymore, and everything else I need, like pictures I take on my phone, are all in the cloud. There’s a tiny square Touch ID sensor that let me unlock the MacBook with a tap of my finger. I appreciate the speed, but I wish Apple included its Face ID technology above the screen instead. I’m used to it on my iPhone XS Max, and there seems to be plenty of room above the display to fit the cameras required. Touch ID feels outdated, since Apple has already moved away from it on its iPads and iPhones. Even with the power boost, the battery life still rocks. I spent most some of my weekend trying to vet Apple’s promise of 13 hours of video playback. I did this by streaming movies from iTunes over and over with the brightness set at medium. The MacBook Air finally died after 11 hours and 3 minutes. That’s short of the 13 hours of video playback Apple promises, but I wasn’t just watching the movies, I was streaming them, which also drains battery life. It’s still incredibly impressive. I really wish Apple kept the original keyboard from the MacBook Air. A lot of people seriously loved the chiclet design and deep key travel — the nice punch you get when you tap a key on the keyboard.

Any weakness in Apple’s flagship segment could shake the company’s shareholders and would be difficult to make up. Apple has been publicly downplaying its smartphone segment in lieu of its burgeoning Services category and what the company calls Other Products. Services includes such things as the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay and cloud services. Other Products includes hardware like the Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod. The business segments are two of Apple’s and CEO Tim Cook’s favorite talking points, but they’re unlikely to produce revenue levels anywhere close to the iPhone. For Apple’s fiscal year 2018, Services revenue totaled $37 billion and Other Products revenue totaled $17 billion. IPhone revenue totaled $167 billion. “We think curation, security, privacy and original content can keep side-loading to a minimum and that Apple’s strengths in edge processing keep it the best platform for new services,” analysts for Guggenheim wrote in a note published this week. “But while that model continues to grow and helps support the stock’s [price-earnings ratio], we still consider Apple a ‘product’ company.” Analysts and shareholders are still hoping for true-to-form Apple innovation — augmented reality “smart” glasses or a self-driving car product, perhaps — but the company has been slow to update on those projects. Last year Cook said the technology for augmented reality glasses wouldn’t be ready “any time soon.” In the meantime, Apple’s stock keeps falling — often in tandem with its so-called FAANG stock peers. The typically high-rising shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet have all taken downturns in recent weeks. In the last 3 months, Facebook has shed 23 percent, Amazon 20 percent, Netflix 21 percent and Alphabet 15 percent. “The fact that the stocks have kept going up despite what the underlying businesses were doing gave them an air of invincibility and made them seem less risky than they are,” Mike Huffman, chief investment officer at Vermont-based Rock Point Advisors, told CNBC. “They were bulletproof until a little over a month ago.” Rock Point Advisors, a financial planning firm in Burlington, Vermont, had $346.2 million in",error,513

Pepper, No. 17-204, could have an impact beyond Apple. It could also open up other tech companies that operate electronic marketplaces, like Facebook, Ebay, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, to similar challenges. In a statement, Apple said that its App Store has fueled competition. The company said the store is responsible for the creation of millions of jobs and more than $100 billion in payments to app developers. “We are hopeful the Supreme Court will recognize Apple’s critical role as a marketplace for apps, and uphold existing legal precedent by finding in favor of Apple and the millions of developers who sell their apps on our platform,” the company said. Despite affecting the biggest tech companies in the world, Monday’s case hinges on how the Supreme Court’s justices will apply a decidedly low-tech ruling from the latter half of the 20th century. The precedent the court is revisiting was set in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, a 1977 dispute in which the court ruled in favor of concrete brick manufacturers. The state of Illinois sued the brickmakers for allegedly inflating their prices, causing an increase in the the cost of public building projects. The court ruled that even though the increased brick costs might hurt Illinois indirectly, only the contractors who actually bought the bricks had standing to sue. That established the so-called “Illinois brick doctrine,” which says that only the direct purchaser of a good can collect damages from a monopoly holder. Apple, which is supported by the Justice Department, will argue Monday that it is not directly selling apps to iPhone users. Rather, Apple will say that it is acting as an agent for app developers, who ultimately are selling their wares to consumers. In exchange for the commission Apple takes on app sales, the company provides access to its vast user base and performs other services, such as malware detection. That view is supported by The App Association, an industry group that represents developers. The group has said that, in its view, “the customer is unequivocally buying from the app developer, not the platform the developer sold their app through,” and cautioned that a ruling against Apple could jeopardize the app economy. But the iPhone owners bringing the suit take a different view. They argue that Apple directly sells the apps in its store, and has gone to �",error,513
2697,". Apple has fallen 22.8 percent since Oct. 1, and Microsoft is down just 6.3 percent in that period. “Microsoft has just been slowly going on in the background there, and almost under people’s radar. It’s down but it’s held up better than the market. It didn’t get caught up in all the excitement we saw in a lot of other stocks,” said Hickey. “You look at both of them. They have identical dividend yields right now, 1.7 percent.” Hickey said it’s really not unusual for a stock to fall out of favor, and now it’s Apple’s turn, something that it has experienced before. Watch: Steve Jobs explains the iPhone in 2007 CNBC interview “Maybe the only company that’s reinvented itself better than Microsoft is Apple, but that was 15 years ago,” he said. “They’ve constantly been rivals to each other with each taking turns in the lead.” Apple’s stock is now well below the average Wall Street target of $232, at $174.24, while Microsoft, $107.14 at Tuesday’s close, was just about $20 below the average analyst’s target.  “Microsoft was an example of a company that was a monopoly and became too powerful. I think under this new leadership they figured it out. Whether they deserve to be larger than Apple, I don’t know,” said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. “One of the things about Microsoft, I don’t think their customers are passionate about them. Their business and their brand is a serviceable utility, but as for Apple, people go out of their way to align themselves with Apple and that brand. That’s impressive.” Still, the market has been rewarding Microsoft. Ablin said in reinventing itself Microsoft has finessed a recurring revenue model. “Apple, for as great as it is, draws most of its revenue from one-time sales,” he said. There is just a small group of 11 companies that have been number one, going back to 1925. AT&T, as the former Ma Bell, held that title for 59 years, while IBM was at the top for 21, according to S&P Dow Jones data. Exxon was the biggest company for several years in",error,513
2709,"-minute time slots. The company is emphasizing it’s looking for “different” content, as long as it has substance and isn’t gratuitous. The push is pitting them directly against deep-pocketed distributors like Netflix and Amazon, who also are hungry for content that is likely to get acclaim. Apple has indicated it is willing to pay premium prices for shows that have awards potential. Van Amburg and Erlicht, who were previously presidents of Sony Pictures Television, are highly respected in the entertainment industry. One of their biggest successes was bringing “Breaking Bad” and its showrunner Vince Gilligan to Sony. The duo has made it very clear they are now looking for Apple’s version of the series, which revolved around an high school teacher turned meth dealer. But so far, the projects Apple has announced aren’t rocking the boat. “Amazing Stories” has been described as a softer version of Netflix’s “Black Mirror,” while “Top of the Morning” is a broadcast news drama — basically a safer version of HBO’s “Newsroom,” as one person characterized it. Despite the push for its “Breaking Bad,” Apple is not only interested in adult content. It’s also in the market for kids’ programming, focusing on buying shows for preschoolers this year. Starting next year, the company will start looking at shows for school-aged children. It is expected Apple will have parental controls to help parents shield children from watching inappropriate content. The immediate goal is to build a content library for an upcoming media service, several people said. At some point next year, Apple will announce the product and offer the content for free on its devices. The first slate of shows have a tentative deadline of spring 2019, and the company is expected to spend $4.2 billion on content through 2022 per Variety. But in conversations with TV show creators and agents Van Amburg and Erlicht have also painted a long-term vision of more advanced interactive and immersive content. These plans are not imminent and are not driving which shows they’re aiming to buy, but are rather an example of the kind of advantages Apple could bring to the table. Some industry executives have questioned if Apple has a chance to steal eyeballs away from Netflix, Amazon and other industry leaders considering the already competitive landscape. WarnerMedia has indicated it too is willing to invest heavily into new shows and movies. Still",error,513
2710,"’s slightly faster with the new model. “Hey Siri” works well, too. Just speak that phrase and you can request a playlist. (But it only works for Apple Music. Other services, like Spotify, aren’t supported.) The microphone is impressive and was almost always able to hear me. I liked the convenience of using this to send a text message, though it felt a little weird doing this in public, as if I was talking to myself. Plus, you can still pull up Siri on the first gen model by tapping the side of those AirPods. The battery life is great. I never had issues with my first-generation model, but my colleagues said they would often die after about an hour-long phone call and would need to be recharged in the case. I talked on the phone for 40 minutes straight and that drained the battery to 81 percent, which is a big improvement. Apple promises up to three hours of talk time, so you’ll probably get close to that. Calls were clear, too. People thought I was talking right on my phone, and Apple made enhancements that specifically focus on call quality. It’s even better than Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds, which are a good alternative if you don’t own an iPhone or want something different. The price, $200, is a lot to spend on headphones, so save money and get the model without wireless charging for $159, which still includes better battery life and “Hey Siri” support. Wireless charging would have been a lot more appealing if Apple launched AirPower, a product that was officially canceled last week and would have allowed you to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time. Without AirPower, you need to have a separate wireless charging just to juice up AirPods, and I found I just didn’t use that function as much as I thought I would. Maybe if future iPhones let you wirelessly charge the AirPods that feature will be more compelling, but right now it isn’t. Ultimately, this model is a tiny upgrade over the first one. You don’t get water resistance, a feature other sportier buds have. They also don’t have noise canceling, like other pricey headphones have. The AirPods are the same size and shape as the standard wired buds that come with your iPhone, and they stayed in my ears just fine while working out in the gym.",error,513

KeyBanc said they see opportunities for growth in several areas of Nordstrom’s business. “We view demand weakness as transient, and 12x 2019 P/E is attractive – we upgrade to Overweight. Since our downgrade of JWN in July 2018, demand has weakened and the forward multiple has compressed >3 turns. Our recent meetings with co-CEO Erik Nordstrom and CFO Anne Bramman also affirm our framework that JWN is prepared to transition its asset base as e-comm continues to grow and that it is in two fundamentally attractive sectors of softlines retail: premium and off-price. We establish a $55 PT.” Cowen said after a challenging 2019, they expect Wendy’s to “reaccelerate” sales in 2019. “Wendy’s is pursuing the right strategy in 2019 by returning to the brand’s premium roots, in the backdrop of a less aggressive value-oriented landscape in 2019 vs 2018. We expect in-line results in 1H19, with greater likelihood for upside in 2H19, to restore investor confidence and help close the valuation gap vs. peers. We view the risk/reward as favorable with 2:1 upside/downside ratio.” Citi said Under Armour is, “growing up,” and is focusing on profitability and ROIC. “We are assuming coverage with a Buy rating (from Neutral previous) and a $29 target price (from $23 previous). UAA is growing up with a renewed focus on driving profitability and ROIC. After chasing 20%+ top line growth during the 2010-2016 period, UAA has taken action to adapt to the changing athletic landscape. With just a 3.4% EBIT margin in 2018, UAA has the opportunity to recapture 600bps+ in EBIT margin over the next several years. And near-term, we see upside to management’s F19 gross margin guidance.” Citi said that they like many other specialty retailers, Footlocker is also facing too many headwinds. “We are assuming coverage with a Neutral",error,513
2716," rating (vs previous rating of Buy) and a $68 TP (vs. $72 prior). While FL has tailwinds at its back in North America with comps inflecting positively in 4Q18, the company still faces many of the same headwinds as other specialty retailers (significant mall exposure; EBIT pressure from DTC). And while FL has a strong partnership with NKE (which accounts for 66% of FL purchases), we believe NKE’s DTC ambitions are a secular headwind.” J.P. Morgan said that homebuilders should see “positive momentum,” in to earnings season. “Additionally, as we recognize a more stable demand backdrop following the continued decline in rates, and review our ratings ahead of earnings, we upgrade PHM and KBH to Neutral from Underweight and raise our Dec. 2019 price targets on these names by 6% and 12%, respectively.  Notably, however, while we recognize that the positive momentum in the sector will likely continue in the near-term, at the same time, we remain hesitant to ascribe target multiples that are greater than prior mid-cycle valuations; hence, our target multiples still result in 10% average downside potential for the group against current stock prices, particularly as our 2020 EPS estimates remain 5-10% or more below the Street consensus for several names across our universe.” Nomura Instinet said that while Tesla is a, “disruptor,” in the industry, they have concerns about the company’s global expansion. “Similar to some of the software greats’ disruption of enterprise hardware, TSLA is a true disruptor of the automotive industry, in our view. It forces legacy combustion engine behemoths to scramble to develop competing products without cannibalizing their cash flow machines—keeping them comfortably at a distinct disadvantage, similar to what Salesforce (CRM) did when it pioneered the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model. We see several moats in the TSLA approach, and we applaud the company for blazing these trails and leading the way in creating a sustainable electric vehicle (EV) revolution and automating transportation. That said, we are cautious near term, as we navigate the breakneck pace of TSLA’s global expansion.” Barclays said the consumer goods company’s margins look “exposed.” “Unilever plans to grow 200bp",error,513
2716," ahead of its market growth (1% from market share gains and 1% from Portfolio) but this is not happening because of acquisition mis-steps (Blue-Air in China) and global share gains of 50% rather than the 60% needed to deliver its medium-term top-line targets. We are concerned about the performance of its Beauty and Personal Care division, its biggest, most profitable and strategic business (38% of sales, 48% of EBIT) which has had two mediocre years and is being left behind in growth terms by L’Oréal and Estee Lauder, which are much more premium. Its margins also reached 22% in 2018, 360bp above L’Oréal and 530bp above Estee Lauder, where we would question sustainability. Management has not closed the door to a margin reset, saying they would always favour growth over margin, but it will depend on whether it can improve its competiveness in short order. Even if it hits the 20% margin target in 2020, it will likely be difficult to persuade the market that there is much runway beyond then. Finally, we think the aborted move to simplify the NV/PLC structure reduces the likelihood of big corporate change that could drive a re-rating.” UBS said that 2019 EPS estimates should see upside for the biotech company. “Following the failure of selonsertib in NASH, Gilead has rattled off two important clinical wins: positive Descovy PrEP data and filgotinib FINCH1/3 data – unlocking two $2B+ revenue opportunities and going far to de-risk outer year (2021+) growth. In the near-term, despite a likely 1Q EPS miss, we expect 2019 EPS estimates will move higher as NASH pre-commercialization spend likely comes out of SG&A guidance. We expect this will more than offset any modest 1Q weakness (on seasonal factors). Coupled with strong Biktarvy / Truvada demand trends, we are moving our 2019 EPS estimates to $6.85 from $6.73. With that as a near-term tailwind and increased conviction on the mid-term growth outlook, we are upgrading to Buy.

We see meaningful financial opportunity longer term, as we estimate ~10% FCF accretion within three years that should enable sustained dividend growth (4.4% yield currently) despite rapid debt repayment. We see a potential negative surprise from sizeable near-term EPS dilution (~11% impact in CY20E); we are undeterred, as the biggest drag is from the required writedown of Red Hat’s deferred revenue under GAAP accounting which has no material impact on FCF and should fade quickly thereafter. Further, the acquisition has yet to close; while IBM is confident in a 2H19 timeline, we nonetheless acknowledge it represents risk to our view.” Credit Suisse sees significant opportunity with Xerox in a, “secularly declining industry.” “We believe Xerox is in the early stages of a multi-year margin expansion and FCF self-help story. Despite challenges to revenue growth amid a secularly declining industry, we see significant opportunity trapped in opex and working capital to unlock.” Morgan Stanley downgraded KDP saying they see single-serve coffee penetration is slowing down. “We are downgrading KDP to UW from EW, with our survey and analysis underpinning our ~250 bps downside in coffee system sales growth relative to high market expectations of ~4% priced into the stock from a DCF-implied standpoint. Our ~80 bps below consensus corporate revenue forecast is supported by takeaways from our survey in terms of slowing household penetration and further pressure in pod pricing. From a valuation standpoint, a high valuation bar (~17x NTM EV/EBITDA) and our below-consensus estimates create a -2.3:1.0 negatively skewed risk-reward. We are lowering our KDP price target by ~11%, from $27 to $24, reflecting our lower coffee estimates and a lower assumed multiple.” Bank of America double downgraded the stock and said market conditions are deteriorating in the U.S. “We downgrade U.S. Steel to Underperform from Buy on worse near-term U.S. market conditions than we anticipated, with channel checks telling us not only have recent price hikes not stuck but benchmark hot rolled coil retreated to its lows of the year in recent days.

We believe management has done an impressive job delivering, but we see limited upside from here until competition from NOVO’s semaglutide franchise and LLY’s overall immunology portfolio is more fully understood. As a result, we are downgrading LLY to Neutral but are now removing our price target and estimate the fair value to be in the range of $125-135/share.” J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock after meeting with management saying they see, “high visibility to +20% annual net income growth.” “FIVE targets 20% annual revenue growth on high-teens unit growth expansion and low-single-digit comps (i.e., +3.0%) with roughly flat margins and a 3% fixed cost hurdle equating to 20% net income growth. Importantly, we see high visibility to +20% annual net income growth based on (1) high-teens unit growth with new store returns the sole governor, (2) low-single-digit “core” comps (ex craze trends) on positive store traffic, and (3) margin expansion driven by scale citing opportunity to reduce today’s +3% fixed cost hurdle over time. We upgrade to Overweight and raise our Dec ’19 price target to $150 (was $133) based on 40x our FY20E EPS, representing a 1.8x PEG on our FY20/21 model and management’s long-term annual 20% net income growth profile representing a premium to 1.5x 2020E growth peer average.” HSBC said they like Lyft’s prospects but that their number 2 position may put them at a",error,513

So where’s the deal? “Part of me wonders if Apple still might buy Disney before the November launch,” said Eric Jackson, founder and president of EMJ Capital Ltd., which invests in tech and media companies. “Putting my conspiracy hat on, maybe that is why they both named it ‘Plus.’” Buying Disney would be an extreme action, as Disney would be buying a lot more than its streaming service. Apple would have to buy the theme park business, which took in more than $20 billion in revenue last year. It would have to buy ESPN and the traditional cable network business, the movie and TV production studio, and all the Fox assets for which Disney just paid $71.9 billion. It would have to buy the BAMTech streaming platform and the consumer products business and everything else that goes into a company with a $237 billion market cap. Apple can afford it. It ended the first quarter with $245 billion cash on hand. Whether regulators would allow it is a different question. “Apple should’ve bought Disney a couple of years ago instead of messing around with their buybacks, dividend and debt,” Jackson said. But if Apple doesn’t want to bet the company on Disney, is there a licensing agreement to strike? Disney will want Disney+ to be available to as many homes as possible, so it wouldn’t want to restrict consumer access by limiting potential customers. But what if Apple somehow mixed its original content with Disney’s product to offer a blended subscription service to Apple device owners?  Adding Disney content would give Apple+ a much deeper library. It would eliminate the “too many streaming services” problem. It would help Disney reach Apple device users (which, as Oprah said, “are in a billion pockets, y’all!”) It’s possible Apple doesn’t care as much about the Disney catalog and only wants to focus on original programming. Investors may be overvaluing the Disney catalog as a draw, said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Group. “Apple will spend more on original programming in year one and at a lower price than Disney,” said Greenfield, who still expects Apple’s original shows to be free for device owners. But the timing of the events -- and just how different they were -- is at least a little head scratching. “If Apple rolled out",error,513
2729," feature is increasingly important to Apple as it leans on services revenue to offset the slowing growth of iPhone sales. Google, meanwhile, has Google Pay, a similar online system that lets customers buy things in the app store or tap to pay on Android devices. Facebook, which lets users make payments via its Messenger feature in certain markets, is also reportedly working on a way to use cryptocurrency to facilitate payments through WhatsApp. Du Toit said Google and Facebook appear to be getting into payments to make it easier for a customers to follow through with a purchase based on advertising. For instance, Facebook offers a feature through Instagram that allows users to buy products directly inside the app. Data from such transactions can be valuable to prove to advertisers that it worked, and the customer actually bought something, du Toit said. And then there’s Amazon, which has a small-business lending arm that has facilitated more than $3 billion in loans to more than 20,000 of the merchants on its e-commerce platform. It has a debit card-like product called Amazon Cash, which allows users to put money into an Amazon wallet and buy online without a credit card. There’s also Amazon Pay, which lets consumers buy things on other sites without reloading their credit card information. Amazon’s playbook seems to aim at building a closed-loop system and cutting out another middle man, du Toit said. “There’s massive cost savings from not having to pay interchange on a purchase — there’s immediate savings on the back of that,” the Bain consultant said. “But second, it starts to deepen into the relationship with the customer and fulfill the mission of being able to sell anything that you could possibly want to buy online.” Despite their push into financial services, U.S. tech giants have stopped short of becoming banks themselves, in part because of the historic wall separating banking and commerce. Since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, companies involved in commerce couldn’t also become banks out of fear that a hybrid company would make irresponsible loans to itself or unfairly deny competitors’ loans. Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, tried for nearly a decade to break that barrier by establishing its own bank. Whether it attempted to buy a local bank or apply for its own charter, each time the giant was stymied by a consortium of regulators, lobbyists, lawmakers and watchdogs. It eventually gave up, withdrawing its request for a charter in 2007. “We’re not",error,513
2729," trying to be banks,” said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, an alliance of companies including Amazon, Apple and Google that advocates for e-commerce technologies. “We’re approaching those customers the way we typically approach customers as technology companies, and doing our best with the financial partners that we have. For a while, that’s the way it’s going to be.” Even the partnership route can be complicated in the United States, which has more stringent regulations than Europe and Asia. Amazon is reportedly looking to partner with J.P. Morgan Chase to launch checking accounts, which would give the e-commerce company even more customer data and allow it to avoid some transaction fees. But according to a January report in The Wall Street journal, regulatory issues have complicated the project. It’s unclear if Amazon will go forward with J.P. Morgan or any other bank, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the negotiations. Still, the partnership model can be mutually beneficial to both sides. “Banks are uniquely skilled at understanding treasury management, compliance, and credit risk management,” said Nigel Morris, co-founder of Capital One and now a partner at venture capital firm QED Investors. Those areas can be difficult for big tech to match. Tech companies, meanwhile, “are uniquely capable of originating customers, delivering a great user experience and selling innovative products that customers love,” he added. That doesn’t mean bank executives don’t view tech giants as a threat. When asked about the Apple Card at a banking conference this month, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said he was worried about the risk of being disrupted. “Everybody’s a threat to us,” Moynihan told CNBC. “I wake up every morning paranoid about who’s trying to wipe us out. But I think they’re threats we can handle.” As a result, the banking industry isn’t sitting still. In 2015, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in his annual shareholder letter that “Silicon Valley is coming” to try to eat the industry’s lunch. So for the past few years, big banks have been preparing for upstarts by building their own applications, reorganizing their tech staffs to innovate faster and partnering with fintech firms.

I mean, wow, it’s Warren Buffett is investing in the company. And, yeah, so it felt great, I think for the whole company. Because we knew that he didn’t, he’s been very clear, he didn’t invest in technology companies and companies he didn’t understand. He’s been totally clear with that. And so he obviously views Apple as a consumer company, and in a different kind of way. I think that’s really special. BECKY QUICK: Well, I wanted to talk to you about that too. Warren, since he bought the stock, and a lot of other people since then have also said the same thing, that it’s a consumer company, not a technology company. How do you feel about that? Because I still think of you as a tech company too. TIM COOK: We’re in the tech industry, but we work at that intersection of technology and the liberal arts and the humanities. And so we make products for people, and so the consumer is at the center of what we do. And so I love the fact that he looks at us like that, because we want consumers to look at us like that. We believe that technology should be in the background, not the foreground, and that technology should empower people to do things and help them do things they couldn’t do otherwise. But if things appear as technology, they’re not used very much, you know. They are for other people, not for all of us. And so I love the fact that he looks at it like that. BECKY QUICK: Well, how do you think of the company just in terms of what your mission is, how do you go about doing things? We hear from different companies. Amazon’s always talking about how it’s about the customer. What is your kind of modus operandi? TIM COOK: Our mission is to make the best products in the world in those areas that we choose to participate that enrich people’s lives. And so, if we can’t make the best product, we don’t go in. If we can make a",error,513
2740," great product, but it doesn’t help anybody, it doesn’t enrich their life, then we’re not gonna go in that either. That’s a pretty narrow funnel then, because you’re working on a few things. And we know that in order to do them at the quality level that we want to do them, we can only do a few. And, you know, we can do more than we used to do, because we’re a bit larger now. But still, in the scheme of things, relative to the size of Apple, we do a very few things. BECKY QUICK: How does that work, just in terms of processing? Are there dozens or even hundreds of projects that are taking place that eventually funnel their way to where you make that decision about which one’s gonna be the next one you jump on? TIM COOK: It’s not nearly as formal as that. Apple is, in some ways, it’s like a big start-up, in that it has an informality about it. And the company tends to run itself horizontally. And so we’re functionally organized, but teams work together on projects. And these teams are empowered to come up with new things. And people are coming up with new things that are not in those teams as well. And so there’s a nice heavy debate culture in Apple where the best ideas are debated. And then we choose from the best of the best to decide what to spend our time on. BECKY QUICK: I think Apple has probably always had a culture of debate. Is it a culture of nicer debate these days? TIM COOK: Is it nicer? Oh, some people think I’m nice, and some people think I’m not. And I don’t, you know, I let other people conclude that. What I believe in, I think collaboration is very key for us. You can’t run a structure where you want all the products in the company to work together well, if the company isn’t working together well. You know, or otherwise, that shows up at the customer. And so, I think collaboration is key, but debate is also key. And to have a healthy tension and debate is fundamental to coming up with great ideas. And so, I suspect if some people could be invisible and step into some of our meetings, they would think, “",error,513
2740,"Oh, these folks don’t like each other.” But really and truly, people at Apple... it’s like a big family in a way. But big families argue and debate things as well, and we do that too. BECKY QUICK: What’s a topic of debate at headquarters these days? TIM COOK: There’s always a debate on what will happen, what categories we should go in, what categories we should not go in. We debate about features. We debate about trends. We debate about new technologies, because choosing which technology to bet on many years before that technology makes itself to a customer and makes a difference is really key, because these things are very long-term investments. We debate about where to put our emphasis in geographies. We debate everything, but in a good way. BECKY QUICK: I won’t ask you to tell me about a debate that’s taking place specifically right now, because obviously that’s proprietary. But tell me about a hotly debated subject that we might already know the answer to. Just give me a story about how something that works. One that you remember saying, “Oh, this was a big debate.” TIM COOK: Well, there was a healthy debate about going into the watch space. Right, a very healthy debate. And about what it could eventually do for people, and how much emphasis to place on the health and fitness side of that. You know, where to put the relative balance. You could imagine, there’s an incredible set of features in the watch just to do things like curate when you’re interrupted, and people are now taking calls on them. And sort of the things that you would think is part and parcel to the iPhone, but in a curated manner. And, or you could, to put the emphasis on fitness and health and so forth, and we’ve elected to do some of this in a great way. But we put an enormous amount of energy in the health and-fitness and wellness side as well. And that was a new area for us. And so a healthy debate should have happened, and it did. BECKY QUICK: Obviously, you were on the side of really embracing that in the end, because nothing’s gonna get made without you signing off on it. Were you always on that side, or did you come around in the debate? TIM COOK",error,513
2740,": You know, I’ve always thought that if you want to enrich somebody’s life, one of the most important things, or certainly in the top two or three is their well-being. And I think because of a number of factors in society and so forth, people have sort of outsourced a bit of how they wanna feel to their doctor. And we’ve always been about empowering the person and democratizing things. And now all of a sudden, you can do an E.C.G. on your wrist. Now all of a sudden, this thing will alert you if it believes you have A-fib. And it doesn’t replace the doctor, obviously. But people don’t wake up one day and say, “Oh, let me get an E.C.G. today,” right? It’s, maybe you have one or two or three in a lifetime. And maybe you only have them if you have a really serious thing that’s happened a number of times. Now you can do it anytime. And I’m getting so many notes from people that have found out they do have A-fib, and they’ve told me that their doctor has told them that, if they would not have reached out, they would have had a very serious, very, very serious health issue. And, you know, these are profound things. The notes I get from people that have lost a ton of weight, because this thing gets you in a mode where you want to close these rings. And it is. It’s sort of a true North. BECKY QUICK: In terms of counting how many steps or counting how much activity you’ve done? TIM COOK: Exactly, because we can all kid ourselves. “Oh, I think I’ve done a lot today.” But, you know, this thing tells you the truth. And so I just see all of these tentacles for people. I’ve seen where people went off, they didn’t have their phone with them, they got into an extraordinary issue. One guy turned over in a car. He sent me a note saying, “My phone went out the window when the car rolled over. I was on this country road, nobody within a distance. I would have been left for dead, if I wouldn’t have been able to contact emergency services.”",error,513
2740," I’ve had both young people and older people tell me that the fall detection on here has gotten them out of a huge jam because they had a problem and they fell. And not in a way that they could get back up, right? And so I look at these things, and I see the kind of things we’re doing with health records. I see the kind of things we’re doing with the V.A. And I just think we’re on the cusp of a very long path to helping people. And if you can help people, you can build a big business out of that. BECKY QUICK: Yeah. Let’s talk about a debate that you’ve been front and center on in the public sphere, and that’s privacy. TIM COOK: Yes. BECKY QUICK: You have been very outspoken about this. TIM COOK: Yeah. BECKY QUICK: When did Apple make that decision to say, we are not going to sell our customers’ data, we’re gonna protect it, we think that’s an important one? TIM COOK: It’s sort of foundational to the way we think, because we work for the consumer. And so we if we can convince you to buy an iPhone, we’ll make a little bit of money. But we don’t want to use you as our product. And we just have a fundamental issue with doing that. And we’ve always thought that the building of a detailed profile about your life... could result in tragic things, whether it’s a breach of your own privacy or something where the data itself could be used in a nefarious way. And so, we’ve never thought it was right to do it, and we’ve always thought that you own it. I don’t own your data; you do. And we’ve sort of got ourselves that we feel a level of responsibility, that we know that more about you is on your phone than anywhere else in your life. I mean, your phone knows your thoughts. Your phone knows your friends, your kids, maybe where they are. It knows your financials. It knows your health data. It has all of this information far beyond anything else in your life. If a burglar broke into a house and went through every drawer in your home, they would know a lot less than if they opened",error,513
2740," your phone. And so, we think with that comes a great responsibility on us to help you, because everybody can’t be a computer scientist and figure out how to do all of these things. BECKY QUICK: Facebook and others have taken a different tack. A different business model. And I think some of what’s happened from that may be part of the reason that Washington and other regulators are really looking to crack down on big technology. They’ve lumped you in with the bunch that they’d like to kinda break up potentially. Do you get frustrated by that? TIM COOK: I’m frustrated that tech is painted as monolithic. Tech is not monolithic. That would be like saying, “All restaurants are the same,” or “All TV networks are the same.” You know, they all have their own personality and characteristics and so forth. And so, if you look at Apple, we’re large, and we’re geographically in the same location as a lot of tech companies. And that is about the extent of the commonality. Market cap may be another one perhaps, but put those aside. I don’t think anybody would call us a monopoly, or anybody that has a very deep, antitrust kind of mindset. Because you look at our share. We have 15% share in the world on smart phones and eight or nine on personal computers, and so on and so forth. And so the share is clearly not a dominant kind of company or dominant market. That’s different depending upon which of these companies you look at, right? The privacy thing is a huge difference. We don’t traffic in your data. We very much are on your side. We also curate our platform. We’ve always viewed that there’s a web, and we support a free and open web. And we support net neutrality. But we’ve never viewed that our platform should just be a replication of this. We think it should be... unique and curated, and we think our customers want that. That they want the safety, security, and privacy that goes along with that. And so we’ve always curated... we don’t get wrapped up in a pretzel about saying, “No, that doesn’t go on our platform, no that app doesn’t work, and therefore it’s not going in the App Store",error,513
2740,".” I know that that has opened us for criticism. But it’s a part of being a shop owner or whatever. If you own the shop on the corner, you decide what goes in your store. And so I think a lot of these kind of things make sound bites and maybe play in politics with elections and these sort of things. But I don’t view them as having deep substance in them, and I believe they are at the root, as you point out, tech is being painted with a big roller. And it needs to be painted with a fine-tipped brush. BECKY QUICK: When Steve Jobs was running Apple, and Bill Gates was running Microsoft, they were kind of each other’s nemesis. They had a frenemies type of relationship, where they respected each other, but they definitely competed pretty harshly. Who’s your nemesis? TIM COOK: I don’t view that I have one. I’m sure there’s a lot of people who don’t like me. And I hope there’s a lot of people that do. But, I mean, for us we compete with a whole bunch of people. It’s a fierce market. We compete on the operating system side with Google and Microsoft. We compete in the hardware space with Samsung and Huawei and many other prominent Chinese companies, in particular. We compete in the PC space with Dell to H.P. to Lenovo. And so each one of these markets we’re in has a significant number of competitors. But... I don’t fixate on the personalities or the company. We focus on the customer, and always ask ourselves, “What more can we do for the customer?” You know, and so that’s how we look at it. BECKY QUICK: Finally, I just want to ask you about the share buybacks. Another $75 billion that’s been authorized for repurchases. Warren Buffett’s been talking about that today. He’s a huge fan of it. Have you spoken with him at all about that? TIM COOK: You know, this is a funny story a bit, is back in 2012, I’d been in the CEO spot maybe a year or so. We had a growing amount of cash. I think we had just crossed the $100 billion mark, if my memory is correct. And I",error,513
2740," was getting lots of input from a lot of different people, as you can guess. And when I don’t have experience in something, I always make a list of the people that I think are the smartest people that I can contact to talk to them and get advice. And Warren was on the top of the list. As you can imagine, I’d never met Warren before. And so I get his number. I call out into Omaha. And I’m think — I wasn’t sure he’d take the call. You know, I’m just sort of calling outta the blue. He doesn’t know me from Adam. But he took the call, and I had a great conversation with him. And that was the first time that I’d met Warren. And he was very clear to me. I still remember it. He said, he goes, “Let me just cut through it. If you believe your stock is undervalued, you should buy your stock.” And I thought that was just the simplest way of looking at it. So here’s what we do is, we first and foremost take care of our people, and we take care of the company and the future of the company. And we’ve been investing a ton in both this country and some others. We’re gonna spend $350 billion in the United States in building new sites. And we’ve just got the new expansion in Austin and so forth. So all of that is number one, right? And then if we have money leftover, we look to see what else we do. We acquire everything that we need that can fit and has a strategic purpose to it. And so we acquire a company on average, every two to three weeks. BECKY QUICK: Small companies. TIM COOK: They’re small companies. We don’t announce them. We are primarily looking for talent and intellectual property. BECKY QUICK: Every two to three weeks, you’re buying a company? TIM COOK: Every two to three weeks.  BECKY QUICK: I had no idea. TIM COOK: We bought probably 20 to 25 companies in the last six months or so. And then, we look at, what do we have leftover? And if we’ve got something leftover, we look at where we can place it. And the top value that we believe we",error,513
2768," claim that 1 employee out of 132,000 full-time equivalent employees at AAPL (and another 17M supplier employees who build AAPL products/components) could be this important to AAPL, we see Ive’s contributions to AAPL products as central to the company’s design-centric strategy, which has propelled it to one of the largest companies in the world over the last 20 years. We are confident that AAPL can find others internally to fill some of his responsibilities, while what can’t be filled by other subordinates, could be supported by what Ive’s new company, LoveFrom, will contribute to AAPL’s process externally when the firm launches in 2020.” “We view Sir Ive’s departure as disadvantageous for the company. But AAPL is undertaking a transition from being focused on hardware products to services and content. While it remains unclear how Apple’s future hardware product innovation may be impacted without Ive, the multiple stakeholders that will be tasked with design decisions going forward will undoubtedly open a new chapter in Apple’s design language. Sir Ive will continue to work with Apple on exclusive projects in his new proprietorship.” “While investors may rue a resignation of a long-time executive, we consider this a sensible and even expected time for Mr. Ive to disengage, at least officially... an essential design influence for close to 30 years. Mr. Ive and his small team of designers played a vital role in Apple’s industrial design across products ranging from the Newton, iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Mr. Ive was understood to share a similar design aesthetic with Steve Jobs, which allowed a close collaboration. Mr. Ive’s departure is a sentimental negative. He represents a particularly strong connection to Apple iconic heritage given his intimate role in developing many of Apple seminal products and of course his tight bond with Mr. Jobs himself. His departure, therefore, should prompt much nostalgia, and may lead some investors to question Apple’s ability to retain leading industrial design.” “We think any potential impact from Mr. Ive’s departure should be manageable given: 1) Mr. Ive is leaving to start his own independent design company, of which AAPL will be a key client and 2) Apple’s design team leaders Evans Hankey (VP of Industrial Design) and Alan Dye (VP of Human Interface Design)",error,513
2783," again, which was absent on earlier models. Apple still includes the Touch Bar up top, which is a small color display that can be used for scrolling through photos, browser tabs, moving through video and more. I don’t use it often, but also don’t mind it as much as other people who prefer the dedicated row of function keys that’s still sold on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar. Aside from the new keyboard, my second favorite part of the 16-inch MacBook Pro are its speakers. Apple included six speakers under the grilles on either side of the keyboard, and they sound better than on any other laptop I’ve ever used. The speakers are unreal. It’s almost on a par to a regular speaker you might leave in a room, and Dolby Atmos support makes it sound like music is coming from the general vicinity of the MacBook Pro but not directly out of the speakers, which is a nice effect. Normally, at home, I use a HomePod or Amazon Echo to listen to music while I’m working. When I had the 16-inch MacBook Pro, I just used its speakers. They’re also great for movies, with full surround sound moving from one speaker to the other, creating a more immersive effect than just firing noise at you. The display is also really nice. Apple says it’s the best screen ever put in a MacBook, and it’s hard to argue. It’s brighter than the MacBook Air and includes what’s called a P3 wide color gamut so that the colors in photos and videos you edit are more accurate. Again, it’s something professionals care about more than the average Joe. Most importantly, Apple increased the screen size from 15 inches to 16 inches without making the laptop much bigger. It cut out the side bezels around the screen to do this, which means you get a larger display in about the same form factor. Apple also improved the microphone on the MacBook Pro, cutting out background noise for recordings. Apple said it’s confident it’s on a par to a dedicated podcast microphone you might otherwise need to plug in to a computer. I thought it sounded crisp, and it’s definitely a better option than what I’ve found on other computers to date. So, if you’re in a bind and don’t have a microphone but are invited onto a podcast,",error,513
2783," it’ll do the trick. Otherwise, it’s just nice and clear during FaceTime calls. Apple included a 100Wh battery inside the 16-inch MacBook Pro that it says provides up to 11 hours of battery life. It lasts about that long if you do a bunch of things: leave the brightness at 75%, turn off the keyboard lights, turn off some of the fancy display settings like TrueTone and use Safari instead of Chrome or another browser. When I used Amazon Music and Chrome while working at full brightness and with the keyboard lights on max, though, it lasted about 4 hours. So, stick to the basics if you want long battery life on the plane and plug it in when you need real power. But even if you do run out of battery, Apple increased the speed at which the 16-inch MacBook Pro charges. I found it can power up in about 2.5 hours, which is nice considering some laptops with huge batteries take forever to charge. Finally, it’s super powerful if you need to edit videos or photos on the go. You get the latest Intel Core i9 processors, up to 8TB of storage (a $2,256 upgrade!) and up to 64GB of RAM for multitasking (again, another $752 on top of the base model.) My $3,600 review unit was somewhere in the middle, with 2TB of storage, 32GB of RAM and an 8-core Intel Core i9 chip. It’s way more power and space than I need to get my job done, but it sure is nice. I have a few complaints about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. For one, all of that power comes in a pretty big package. The notebook weighs 4.3 pounds and has some bulk to it, but that’s only a little bit heavier than my 2.75 pound MacBook Air. But the large body made it hard to squeeze the computer inside my messenger bag. It felt fine in my backpack, but I definitely knew it was there. Still, it’s a small price to pay if you’re a professional and need to know you have enough power to actually do your work wherever you go. Also, there’s still a 720p FaceTime camera on the front for video chat. It’s fine, but I just feel like at this price Apple could at least upgrade it to a higher quality lens. I’d love to see a 1080p wide-angle lens added",error,513
2783,", especially for family video chats. At this price point, I just expect more. The 16-inch MacBook Pro has 4 modern USB-C ports, which was more than enough for me. I’m used to having just two on a MacBook Air, or one when the other is used for charging. And those ports can power up to four external screens, which is pretty wild. But I know some people who still want a full-sized USB port or an older SD card slot. Just know it’s not here like it was on much older MacBook Pros you might be upgrading from. And finally, I know Apple doesn’t really think people want a touchscreen on a MacBook, and there isn’t one here. I never use touch screens on laptops, so I’m fine with that. But Apple finally has a solution for people who want touch. In the new macOS Catalina software that ships on the 16-inch MacBook Pro there’s a feature called Sidecar that lets you sync up with an iPad to use as a secondary screen. That adds touch and Apple Pencil support, so you can work on the side and fine-tune pictures, sign documents and more. It works well. It totally depends on what type of user you are. If you need as much power as you can get on the go for rendering videos or editing really big photos, then yes, this is a great computer. It’s the best you can buy, especially if you’re already in Apple’s ecosystem and want all the latest stuff. This is the best MacBook Apple has ever made, too, in terms of what you get: great speakers, a keyboard that really works, decent battery life (depending on what you’re doing), and an awesome display. But you’re going to pay a lot for it, at least $2,399. That’s more than I can afford to spend on a laptop. If you don’t want to spend that much and aren’t the sort of power user who needs a MacBook Pro, then you should wait a little bit and see what Apple does with its other laptop lines. It’s reasonable to assume that Apple will bring this new keyboard design to more affordable laptops in the coming year, although the company isn’t saying that yet. It makes sense at least for it to add it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which will cost less. But it would",error,513

Inventory data can be complicated at times when oil prices are moving around a lot. It’s an accounting thing, when there’s a change in the valuation of inventories,” he said. “The book values reported by firms may understate the amount inventories are going up. The stuff that’s flowing in costs more than the stuff that’s flowing out. That distorts the numbers.” — Domm The major averages may be vying for their second straight daily gain, but the picture underneath the surface is still worrisome.

And with the new camera angles added, MLB decreased the time a team can decide to dispute a call from 30 seconds to 20 seconds for the 2020 season. Another critical partner will be Sony. Ballparks will have 12 4K cameras and feature Sony’s Hawk-Eye tracking system, which MLB said will help it better track player positioning and movement and “everything that is happening on the field, with no blind spots,” according to Gaedtke. Sony, which renewed its deal with MLB last December, will also provide teams artificial crowd noise. Clubs are required to use some form of fake sounds designed to emulate regular contests with spectators, since games will be held in empty stadiums. Sony has made available 75 samples of crowd sounds from its MLB video game. The league will provide teams with an iPad filled with the samples that will be controlled by an audio technician during games. TWEET Ryan Zander, MLB vice president of broadcast products and services and new broadcast technology, said clubs would continue to provide traditional organists and batter walk-up music in games, too. “The idea is to enable the clubs with as much as possible as it relates to creating a realistic environment,” Zander said, adding that broadcasters will pick up the sound with natural microphones normally used for crowd noise.  MLB said its baseball operations department would handle any disputes around the artificial sounds, but added it’s not anticipating any problems. MLB will also use virtual ads this season to “make up for lost brand exposure” and “create some new inventory for our partnerships,” according to Marinak. The league generally uses virtual signage at premier events like postseason games and the MLB All-Star Game, but not for regular season regional games. MLB will oversee the ads on national broadcasts and clubs will manage local ad placements. But if a club decides to install physical ads for a particular game, MLB could restrict virtual ads. “What we’ve done this season is qualified a bunch of technologies and devised a plan and framework to make this technology available for all clubs who want to take advantage of the program,” said Zander. Zander added there are guidelines to ad placements in efforts to “make the signage look as authentic as possible, not have it be disruptive to the viewer",error,513
2814," much of Big Tech’s recent scrutiny appears populist in nature – either intended to bolster “anti-corporate” credentials or to admonish the political views of their CEOs and employees.  The consequences of this “loose talk” is real – it threatens American jobs at these companies, discourages other would-be risk-takers from setting out on new ventures, and provides cover for other countries to target U.S. business.  After all, if U.S. policymakers are attacking Big Tech, why shouldn’t their counterparts in China and Europe do the same?  Instead of needlessly hurting our most innovative companies, let’s champion their ingenuity and encourage others to replicate it.  Second, let’s use the size of these companies and the unique skill sets of their workers to the government’s advantage.  Let’s harness their cross-cutting strengths through public-private partnerships and joint R&D programs in critical technologies so the United States (and the U.S. military) remains the global leader.  When policymakers consider their options for a modern U.S. industrial policy, working with and further strengthening these American champions is exactly what they should be doing.       Third, let’s tread carefully when it comes to circumscribing the activities of these and other U.S. companies abroad.  There are areas where our companies should not be permitted to engage, such as helping China improve its military capability.  But one of the best ways for America to stay ahead of its global competition is for our companies to sell more in markets like China so they can spend more on innovation in the United States.  Fourth, let’s forcefully back these companies against unfair practices abroad, whether it be unacceptable pressure from China to censor their activities or opportunistic targeting from France for tax revenue.  Such pressure is very difficult for companies to combat alone, and they shouldn’t be criticized for trying.  Rather, the U.S. government should stand by their side and help them to compete fairly in these crucial markets, not encourage them to disengage.       Finally, as we continue to push back against the unfair practices of others, let’s not emulate them ourselves.  Censorship and higher taxes are not the way to create more Apples, Amazons, Facebooks, and Googles.  And using anti-trust tools for political purposes – a trick right out of",error,513
2827,", but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing. “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC. Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year. Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline. “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.” The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting. “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak. “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine. There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations. Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect. Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval. “I think the realism of saying $1.9",error,513
2827," trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.” “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.” Strategists say the trigger for a sell-off could be just about anything. Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley. Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours. Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000. “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night. He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday. “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

2840," cheaper handsets and increasingly affordable data plans,” another eMarketer’s report said. “The number of smartphone users will grow by double digits in every market except North America this year..... A strong demand for messaging services and social media platforms like WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger is driving the expansion of mobile internet access in these regions.” So if “connecting” everyone is Zuckerberg’s primary concern, then Apple — which popularized the app-based smartphone interface — has most certainly played a role. And in turn, while Apple certainly didn’t condone any of Facebook’s data woes — and may disagree with how Facebook makes money — Apple still helps facilitate that business model. There haven’t been any reports indicating that Facebook broke any of Apple’s privacy rules for the App Store during the recent scandal (unlike, say, Uber). Facebook’s apps may be free, but Apple has a reason for hosting free apps: They increase the attraction of iOS. If Apple were to nix Facebook, it would affect any Apple user that falls within the nearly 70 percent of smartphone users on Facebook. App Annie estimates that consumer spending on apps doubled in the past two years, and Facebook properties have been far and away the most popular apps by monthly active users. On Sunday, Facebook was the 12th-most popular app in the Apple App Store, compared to the 24th most popular app on Google Play. It’s been an unusually biting exchange between two CEOs that tend to come off as particularly well-rehearsed in public. Still, the two still call out the flaws in each business model, even if they both gloss over their synergies. As Zuckerberg implies, Apple is the most highly valued public company in the world, at about $850 billion, and holds enough cash to buy General Electric and Ford combined (and still have money left over).  Apple’s average product selling price is about $778, and most of its sales are concentrated in a few regions. But that cost is spread across two years or more (aging batteries and tempting upgrades aside). And Apple certainly could make a ton of money by monetizing its users, as Cook points out:  Apple has 1.3 billion customers — not much different than Facebook’s 1.4 billion daily active users. Meanwhile, though Facebook is free for users, don’t think it’s against raising its own prices for its paying customers — advertisers",error,513
2851," experimenting with touchless gestures and curved screens. If motion detectors were embedded into the screen, it would reduce the need for room in the bezel for sensors. A  patent registered on March 8 shows that the company is still experimenting with how to mount its electronic components underneath the display itself. And the fact that the company has started focusing on producing more of its parts, such as  its own MicroLED screens, has piqued the interest of designers and investors.Samsung currently supplies Apple with OLED screens, but rumors that the company will produce its own screens  has shaken Samsung investors.  Samsung, one of Apple’s biggest rivals in the space, has offered curved screens on its phones  since 2013. Samsung’s Air gestures,  which debuted on the Galaxy S4, allows users to scroll through their phones and pull up information by swiping at the air, which is similar to the touchless gestures described by Apple. But as a race to get the first foldable phone, something that Samsung, Huawei, LG, Oppo, Lenovo, and ZTE all have patents for in addition to Apple, on the market heats up, Apple may no longer be satisfied with relying on its current supply chains. “It’s indicative that they’ve wrung out as much innovation as they can out of current supply chains,” Rolston said. Samsung has already shown in its  MicroLED television “The Wall” that the technology can be used to create a bezel-less experience. If Apple continues to develop its own MicroLED technology, it could be used to further a notch-free design on a smaller device like the iPhone. The company’s move toward wireless charging with the new Apple AirPower,  which is rumored to launch in 2018, could also impact the future of the iPhone’s design in a similar way as did the move to wireless earbuds. For instance, the company could do away with a cable-based charging port, though Jason Snell, editor of Apple news site and podcast Six Colors, and former MacWorld editor, said such a change would make the devices more difficult to repair since most basic repairs require connecting the iPhone to an external computer. The missing home button on the iPhone X provides another potential clue for the future of iPhone design: a continuing war on buttons. “Apple is still on a quest to get rid of as many buttons are they can,” Snell said. He speculates that the iPhone",error,513
2851,"’s side buttons could become completely virtual like the home button. The removal of the home button, of course, came with the introduction of FaceID. It’s unclear what technology would supplant the side buttons. The company has previously experimented with putting volume controls on headphones.Functionality like volume control could eventually be outsourced to the AirPods or even motion detection. It’s unclear what technology would supplant the side buttons.  But there are other potential benefits. “The fewer buttons or ports on the outside of the device, the more freedom the company has to alter the tech on the inside,” Snell said. For instance,  the removal of the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 created room for a larger battery. The reports that Apple is working on a curved screen with gesture control suggests the future of the iPhone might not require touch-based components. “That’s where they’re heading, to sell the consumer a screen they can hold,” Rolston said. But he added that thinking in terms of incremental changes may miss a larger point: As wearables and home devices become more important to the way we use our phones, the design of the phone itself may become less critical. “It will matter less to continue to innovate on the phone itself,” Rolston said. With a company as secretive as Apple, it’s hard to tell how close to market the technology needed to make something like an all-screen device is. Patents filed by the company, dozens of which will never make it to market, hardly guarantee any future design plans. “They’ll make changes to things we consider must-haves today when the technology advances beyond it,” Munster said. What consumers are likely to see in 2018 is a small bump in screen size. A report from Ming-Chi Kuo, a highly respected Apple analyst at KGI Securities, indicates that  2018 will probably bring three new phones, a 5.8 OLED model of the iPhone X, a plus-sized iPhone X with a 6.5-inch OLED screen and 6.1 inch LCD model. It’s reported that like the current iPhone X, these phones will feature the “fullscreen,” minimal notch design with the TrueDepth Camera system. Apple’s next major event, the WWDC, is set for June, but speculation about the next iPhone model release pegs September, though it",error,513
2859," drawing inspiration, ironically, from the Beatles song “A Day in the Life.” He knew the engineers at Apple that were in charge of the ROMs and asked them to sneak it in there right before the computer was released. It made it into the original Quadra computer. Some engineers at Apple were not happy with the change. “Our excuse was it’s too risky to take it back out at this point because something could crash,” he said. “We just made up some bulls---.” It stuck, and years later Apple even trademarked the start-up sound. It’s one of the few sounds that’s trademarked, along with the NBC chimes and the Intel signature sound. “Kind of silly right?” Reekes smirked. “I’m playing a c-major chord and it’s famous and it’s a copyright.” But after more than a decade, Apple got rid of the infamous boot-up chord in its latest models. Now when you turn on your laptop, there is silence. “Now that there’s no start-up sound, it’s like sitting down at a restaurant and there’s no one there to greet you,” Reekes said. “It’s it just feels strange.” Apple’s camera click sound is everywhere. It’s the sound of a screen grab or the noise your iPhone makes when you snap a photo. It comes from Reekes’ old 1970s Canon AE-1 that he purchased in high school. He recorded his camera and then slowed down the shutter speed in order to build the custom sound. “Any time you take a photo with the iPhone it’s my camera, which kind of freaks me out because, even to this day when I hear people take photos with their iPhone I look to see who stole my camera,” Reekes said. He said he has attempted to use it as a pickup line in a bar as well. “Hey, I made that sound!” But Reekes said it mostly just results in a strange look. Today, Reekes is a consultant and is out of the sound design business. He left Apple right before the dotcom crash in the late 1990s. “Unfortunately, my timing was pretty bad,” Reekes sighed. “I",error,513
2861," see at least two or more android-based phones,” he added. Ong declined to name the company that might launch an Android phone with 3D face recognition this year but said that Viavi was in talks with all the major smart phone makers to supply the filters. Some Android phones with 3D sensing capabilities have hit the market in small numbers, such as the Asus ZenFone AR released last year, but those models didn’t use the sensors for facial recognition like the iPhone X does. Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi all declined to comment, as did Samsung, whose current phones use a standard camera for facial recognition. Apple’s effort to get ahead with the technology is the latest evidence of an aggressive approach by the Cupertino-based company to making the most of the technological advances its financial firepower can deliver. The iPhone maker’s $390 million deal in December to secure supplies from VCSEL-maker Finisar was one such move. Another is Apple’s discussions with major cobalt producers to nail down supplies for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones. “Apple is always very focused on its supply chain,” says Gartner’s Erensen. “When it comes to new technologies like this and implementing them to new phones, it’s one of the ways that Apple can really can be aggressive, differentiate and take advantage of the position they have in the market.” Several sector analysts say their channel checks show Apple was initially sourcing VCSELs chiefly from California-based Lumentum and that bottlenecks in production there last year also spurred the $390 million deal with Finisar. Lumentum, which declined to comment, is ramping up additional manufacturing capacity for VCSELs and edge-emitting lasers for the first half of fiscal 2019, according to the company’s earnings call. It will also be helped by the purchase this week of another optical components producer Oclaro Inc. Finisar too, expects to expand in 2019. All of that, however, still leaves the major Android producers searching for their own supplies of VCSELs. Craig Thompson, vice president of new markets at Finisar, says interest in the technology is universal across the sector. “Each customer has their own adoption timeline and rollout plan, which we can’t discuss, but we expect the market opportunity for VCSEL technology to increase substantially in 2019,” he says",error,513
2862,"-depth investigation to assess the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple under the EU Merger Regulation. The Commission is concerned that the merger could reduce choice for users of music streaming services. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: “The way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won’t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.” The proposed transaction involves Apple’s acquisition of Shazam. It would combine two significant and well known players in the digital music industry that are mainly active in complementary business areas. In particular, Apple offers the music streaming service “Apple Music”, which in the last three years has become the second largest music streaming service provider in Europe. Shazam offers the leading music recognition app for mobile devices in the European Economic Area (EEA) and worldwide. Music recognition applications allow consumers to recognise music based on a short audio sample by using microphones built into their mobile devices.  The Commission’s preliminary competition concerns The Commission’s initial market investigation raised several issues relating to the combination of Shazam’s strong market position in the music recognition apps market and Apple’s market position in the music streaming services market. At this stage, the Commission is concerned that, following the takeover of Shazam, Apple would obtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors for the provision of music streaming services in the EEA. Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors’ customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, while at this stage the Commission does not consider Shazam as a key entry point for music streaming services, it will also further investigate whether Apple Music’s competitors would be harmed if Apple, after the transaction, were to discontinue referrals from the Shazam app to them. The transaction was notified to the Commission on 14 March 2018. The Commission now has 90 working days, until 4 September 2018, to take a decision. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.

Despite numerous negative supplier comments over the past few weeks, Apple’s iPhone results weren’t as bad as feared, with units only slightly lower than Street estimates. Two key highlights from the call were the strength in Services and the additional $100B in buyback authorization, which mgmt indicated would be done at a “fast” pace. We continue to be more cautious on iPhone growth in the coming quarters, but admit that the $100B buyback will create somewhat of a floor for shares. With positives and negatives largely balanced at current levels, we view valuation as fair and maintain our Hold.” “AAPL reported an impressive March-qtr beat and guided June-qtr sales ahead of expectations – the quarter was all the more impressive given how negative sentiment was heading into EPS call. March-qtr print came in at $61.2B/2.73 vs. street at $61B/2.69 but more impressive was June-qtr guide for revenues in the range of $51.5-53.5B (vs. buyside at $46-48B). The strength in revenues reflects continued growth from iPhones (+14% revenue, 3% unit growth) coupled with acceleration in services (+31% y/y) and other (wearables, +37% y/y). We think slowly but surely, AAPL is morphing into more than just an iPhone story and is displaying ability to sustain revenue growth irrespective of iPhone trajectory.” “Apple shares justifiably rallied (+3.5% post close) after the company reported better-than-feared F2Q18 results and announced what we believe will be viewed as an as-anticipated capital return update – albeit we had expected a more significant dividend increase (+30% vs. announced 16%); focus on faster pace of $100B share repo authorization.

We maintain our Market Perform rating and $195/sh. target – see our updated valuation summary and DCF model below.” “We expect shares of Apple to be upward biased following better-than-expected results and outlook. Fundamentals were good, whereas capital return was mixed, and this is interesting given we think investors were more focused on potential capital return goodness. Overall, iPhone and services performances put our cautious view in the penalty box, but the magnitude of cap return update is a touch light and could support our view that M&A might have to play a greater role to overcome the maturing iPhone franchise. Our estimate changes take PT to $161, up from $157.” “AAPL reported F2Q18 revenue/EPS of $61.14B/$2.73, vs. consensus of $61.15B/ $2.69E and our estimates of $60.99B/$2.68E. Service revenues beat consensus with impressive 31% Y/Y growth to over $9B for the first time, which set the segment on target to double its FY16 sales by FY20, according to management. Total paid subscriptions across all services grew strongly Q/Q and Y/Y to 270M in the past quarter. We expect an in-line June quarter guidance and a new $100B repurchase program (without end date) to alleviate many investor concerns for near-term “misses.” Our mid- and long-term theses remain unchanged, however, distortions in Android phone release schedule in the past quarters have made it hard to tell if iPhone can remain competitive with fewer differentiated features. “Apple reported revenue in-line and EPS ahead of the Street (1.5% above estimates), with June quarter revenue guidance surprisingly above consensus. For the March quarter, iPhone was essentially in-line, as Apple shipped a total of 52.2M units vs. consensus at 52.5M. iPhone ASP was $728, almost exactly in-line with our estimate of $730, but below the Street at $742. Services revenue was $9.2B (Street at $8.4B) and gross margin was 38.3% (consensus was",error,513

Additionally, Apple announced a new $100B buyback and a dividend increase of 16%. Despite potential for ongoing uncertainty around iPhone X demand, we recommend owning AAPL on potential for a “super-long” cycle, which we expect will include a wider array of “X-gen” devices this fall. Maintain OW, PT to $214.” “iPhone shipments in March grew 3% y/y, just shy of consensus but above our expectations. ASP came in light, down 9% q/q despite a full quarter of iPhone X availability, which echoes our concerns about mix weakening. June quarter guidance paints a similar story, with implied units better than we had modeled under assumptions of more ASP pressure. Services and Greater China growth impressed. We found the dividend raise light, but buybacks are in line with our expectations.” “Guidance leaves estimates essentially unchanged, target $175. Our FY18E EPS modestly rises from $11.40 to $11.48 on higher sales and lower taxes, partially offset by lower other income. We retain our cross cycle 12.6x multiple on CY19E EPS of $14.00 for our $175 target...Apple remains an uninspired investment for now.” “We reiterate our Market Perform rating on Apple following March quarter results. Results held up better than feared, with some incremental weakness on the iPhone, mainly offset by Services. Guidance was largely in-line with consensus, which we think includes some weakness in iPhone, but not as bad as fears into the report. We think the dividend increase and buyback announcement was fully in-line with expectations and therefore a non-event. Looking forward, Apple didn’t provide enough information to fully vindicate iPhone X nor indicate its failure, so we don’t think investor concerns about iPhone units or mix will likely be put to rest until 4Q sell-through data is available in the fall.” “AAPL reported FY2Q18 revenue of $61.14B (up 16% y/y, 1% below our estimates), Operating Income of $15.9B (up 13% y/y, 1% below our estimates), Net Income of $13.8B (up 25% y/y, 1% below our estimates), and EPS of $2.73 (up",error,513

We believe iOS is an ecosystem with falling churn, growing ASPs, and a rising value per customer. We maintain our Buy rating and $210 Target Price.” “Apple beat Mar-qtr revs and EPS, guided the Jun-qtr ABOVE consensus vs. investor worries it would come in below, and announced a new $100B share buyback. Services and Accessories both posted upside as we had previewed. iPhone units grew 3%Y/Y but with ASP up 11%Y/Y iPhone revenue grew 14%Y/Y, with that ASP premium keeping us expecting this to be Apple’s best iPhone REVENUE growth year since FY15. Reiterate BUY and $215 price target.” “Apple reported Q2/F′18 results with revenue and EPS in line with consensus estimates due to steady iPhone unit sales and record services revenue up 31% YoY. iPhone unit sales were better than feared with our recently lowered estimates, and management highlighted consistent results in every geography with the iPhone X the top selling iPhone each week of the quarter. In fact, management highlighted share gains during the quarter in China for both Mac and iPhone. Guidance for the June quarter is slightly above consensus due to ongoing expectations for steady iPhone sales and anticipated strong growth in Services revenue... We believe Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones in September with possible lower price points and greater segmentation could lead to YoY unit growth in C2019.” “Results and guidance in line with our estimates, though better than many feared. iPhone sell-through trends appear only slightly lower than our estimates, which likely exceeded many expectations. At the same time, Services revenue meaningfully exceeded our expectation and appears poised to continue growing quickly. Overall, F2Q revenue and EPS and F3Q guidance were relatively in line with our estimates. We believe results supported our views around market saturation and pricing power, while improving our view of Services sustainability.” “Services growth",error,513
2891," plenty of growth in the business. In the latest quarter, Apple reported a 31 percent revenue increase in services to $9.2 billion, representing 15 percent of total sales. That’s up from 12 percent in the same period two years earlier.  “An acceleration in growth despite Apple’s already large services revenue base is that much more impressive,” wrote Neil Cybart, an analyst at Above Avalon, in a report last week. Apple made a subscription push at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference three years ago, when it introduced Apple Music, a change from its previous strategy of charging for every song or album download on iTunes. It also sells iCloud storage on a subscription basis, with monthly prices ranging from $1 to $10. While investors are showing a clear preference for subscription businesses, they require fundamental shifts in how companies build and support products and how they incentivize salespeople. It costs a lot of money to land a new customer but can take many months, if not years, before that user turns profitable. Also, some users will inevitably stop paying, an issue known in cloud software as churn. Cloud companies typically have automated systems and teams dedicated to getting customers to renew. Apple has become the world’s most valuable company by creating consumer products that people love, not by hiring “customer success” representatives to keep teams paying for iCloud. “The general thought was whenever you change your model, it just created a bunch of uncertainty, which negatively impacts the stock,” Munster said. Still, software is increasingly running in the cloud and legacy businesses are being forced to adapt. Adobe has pushed longtime users of apps to the Creative Cloud, and Microsoft has had success with Office 365, the cloud version of its license-based productivity suite. Some analysts view stragglers as a part of Microsoft’s growth opportunity over the next few years. Apple’s services business could use a similar revenue driver, especially with the smartphone market having reached saturation. In 2016, iPhone revenue — and overall company sales — dropped for three straight quarters, on a year-over-year basis. Munster wrote in a note last week that services will represent 20 percent of Apple’s revenue by 2023. In an interview, he said that Apple could roll out new subscription services in augmented reality, artificial intelligence and video.  Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and a big investor in cloud software start-ups, said the opportunity is clearly there for Apple.",error,513
2906,"ediu: Apple music tweet Apple Music is far from a laggard. If anything, it validates how powerful the Apple platform is that it can be so late to a market and still experience such hyper-growth. Now it’s expanding beyond music into video content. Even if they missed the mark with “Planet of the Apps,” it’s important to remember that Netflix’s first piece of original content was “Lillyhammer” and not “House of Cards” (that was its second). Apple will learn and get better (especially if it hires ex-HBO content head Michael Lombardo, as rumors have suggested lately). If Apple is going to give compelling video and audio content as part of Apple Music, its continued white-hot growth in subs should continue. To be clear, just because Apple Music will continue to grow doesn’t mean that Spotify can’t. It won’t be a zero sum game. Apple Music, Spotify and Netflix can all be successful streaming subscription services. Apple isn’t pushing Apple Music to be a massive moneymaker for them. It’s doing it to allow it to reinvest in a big way into content, making its ecosystem even more valuable than it already is to its users. Yes, Apple Music’s current $3.2 billion-a-year run rate is nothing to sniff at. It’s about half the annual revenue of current stock market darling Nvidia. But even if it got to a $10 billion-a-year run rate with 80 million paid subs, it’s important to recall that Apple’s current annual revenue is $220 billion. Apple Music will always a drop in the bucket. By deciding to charge for Apple Music — instead of giving it away for free — Apple has even more resources to throw at content. Maybe it pays for exclusive music from Drake or Chance the Rapper. Maybe it pays for future “Planet of the Apps.” Or maybe it gives Lombardo (if he joins Apple) a $10 billion-a-year content budget (when Apple gets to 80 million subs) instead of the $2 billion-a-year content budget he had at HBO. Spending $10 billion a year on content is nothing to sniff at. Netflix is spending  $6 billion this year on content. Amazon is spending $4.5 billion. Apple is not dipping its toe in the water with “Planet of the",error,513
2913," ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle. It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware. From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays. The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone. Apple even looked into reinventing the wheel. A team within Titan investigated the possibility of using spherical wheels — round like a globe — instead of the traditional, round ones, because spherical wheels could allow the car better lateral movement. But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines. There was disagreement about whether Apple should develop a fully autonomous vehicle or a semiautonomous car that could drive itself for stretches but allow the driver to retake control. Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people. A similar debate raged inside Google’s self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldn’t be trusted to retake control in an emergency. Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apple’s own programming language, or the industry standard, C",error,513
2914," of Tuesday’s close, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Keeping other things equal, if Apple’s market cap rose to $1 trillion, the stock would be 4.74 percent of the S&P 500′s market cap, Silverblatt said, ranking Apple ninth when looking at the stocks with the largest percentage of the S&P’s market cap at year-end since 1980. IBM holds the top four spots.  If Apple’s stock can reach the $1 trillion market cap and “sustainably be there, I think it validates the belief that Apple is not just a smartphone business but a platform,” Daryanani said.  On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal also reported that Apple is allowing Chinese customers to use Tencent’s popular mobile WeChat Pay system to make App Store purchases. Apple did not immediately provide CNBC with a comment on the news, which was also widely reported by Asian and tech news websites. Apple’s shares could be even closer to reaching $1 trillion if investors bet on greater growth.  CNBC’s Senior Markets Commentator Michael Santoli pointed out that Apple’s 12-month trailing price-to-earnings multiple of just over 18 is low compared with that of tech giants Microsoft, Google’s parent Alphabet and Facebook, whose multiples, he said, range from 27 to 38. The price-to-earnings ratio reflects how many times earnings investors are willing to pay for a share. If Apple reached a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and matched the consensus estimate for fiscal year 2017 earnings per share of $9.45, the stock could reach a $1 trillion market cap at $189 a share, or 15.3 percent higher than Wednesday’s price, Santoli said.  To be sure, the road to any major Apple stock gains is likely not a smooth one. Investors’ initial reaction to an iPhone 8 announcement may be to sell on the news. According to Kensho data, a person who bought Apple stock two weeks prior to an iPhone announcement and sold it three months later had a median gain of just 4.5 percent. With Wednesday’s gains, Apple shares are up 41 percent for the year.  “It continues to be a bet on the iPhone, with a great deal riding on how well the iPhone 8 does,” Aswath Damodaran, a",error,513

Campling noticed that Apple’s inventories, which totaled $4.4 billion in the three months ending December 30, jumped to $7.6 billion in the March quarter. Inventories include completed products as well as components used in Apple devices. He said this was evidence that Apple was stockpiling components in case of any disruption and showed the company was concerned. “It is a defensive/protective measure in case there are difficulties in future procurement or supply chain disruption as Apple is potentially in the crossfire of the U.S./Sino trade war,” Campling wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Among the other large technology firms, Google parent Alphabet is perhaps then next-most exposed. Google makes the mobile operating system known as Android that is used in 77 percent of smartphones in China. While it is open source, Google makes money from the services it offers via Android such as cloud storage, YouTube or Gmail. Should there be an escalation in trade tensions, it’s unclear whether Google may have to stop providing Android to smartphone makers in China, but it’s a risk to consider. Google’s search engine has been blocked in China since 2010 and many of its other services are limited or unavailable. This means it derives very little revenue from China. Similarly, other services-based companies including Facebook and Netflix have zero operations in the country. Facebook is blocked and Netflix has not expanded there. Amazon, as well, is dwarfed by online commerce giants JD.com and Alibaba. Amazon did launch its subscription Prime service in China in 2016, but it is a small market for the U.S. firm. “We continue to strongly believe that, given the primarily services nature of traditional FANG names and very internationally distributed from a revenue perspective with China representing negligible revenue/growth, that Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet are ‘primarily insulated’ from tariff worries and a potential retaliatory trade war with China if negotiations fail to result in a path to an agreement over the coming weeks,” Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Chinese companies could definitely struggle. Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker, relies on U.S. companies like Qualcomm and Intel for components for much of its hardware.

2936,"by said the question is whether the Fed offers any guidance that will provide clues about whether they are on track for another rate hike in December. Concerns about trade wars faded somewhat in the past week, after President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said they would discuss trade issues and not implement any more tariffs during the talks. The Trump administration was also making progress with Mexico toward a revision of the NAFTA trade agreement. But trade will be a focus Wednesday when $16 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to be implemented, and China is expected to put tariffs on U.S. goods in return. Administration officials have said talks with China have basically stalled, which is another reason analysts expect progress with Europe and on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. “I think the market is basically putting it on the back burner now, until new information comes in. I think the fact the president did come up with that truce with the EU was helpful, and then he made a comment that Mexico is next. Something big is going to happen with Mexico,” Krosby said. “The market realizes he does seem under pressure to ease these strident comments, [from] having business plans put on hold, and it was clear also the farmers are not crazy about the bailout.” Bond traders are watching Tokyo next week after rumblings about a Bank of Japan policy change have been sending yields sharply higher. The 10-year Treasury rose to 2.98 percent Friday ahead of the second-quarter GDP report but was back to about 2.96 percent after the report of solid 4.1 percent growth failed to match the loftiest forecasts above 5 percent. Yields move opposite price, and the U.S. 10-year yield has long been kept artificially depressed by the easy policies of global central banks. The last time the 10-year yield was at 3 percent was June 13, the day of the last FOMC meeting, when the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points. The 10-year yield reached the year high of 3.12 percent on May 18. “The BOJ is probably more important than the Fed next week,” said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy, North America at State Street. He said the Bank of Japan could consider changing its policy of ending its targeting of the 10-year yield at zero, but more likely it could just hint at a change later on. “If the JGBs (",error,513
2936,"Japanese government bond yields) move up, we could see the 10-year yield pushing back above 3 percent, certainly. If the BOJ does this, it’s bad for risk generally, including stocks,” he said. Ferridge noted that the European Central Bank is winding down its asset purchases, moving away from the easy stance it adopted during the European debt crisis. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, said if the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, does hit 3 percent, it should not be a problem for stocks unless it continues to shoot higher. A continued flattening of the yield curve would be a bigger concern. “We get more scared if the 10-year doesn’t move up as much in yield as the 2-year does,” he said. The spread between the two yields, at 27 Friday, has been closely watched by the markets, since a flattening curve can be a warning about the economy, and one that actually inverts is viewed as a recession warning. “In an ultimate move in the 10-year yield back over 3 percent, equities don’t get sold on that unless the 2-year moves up higher and faster,” said Hogan. “If we get a new high on the yield, that’s also a new flavor.” “The last time it happened, the market freaked out. Then it calmed down again,” Hogan said. The stock market will take a 3-percent 10-year in stride “unless we break out to a new cycle high or the increase in the 10-year is matched by a faster pace and yield in the 2-year,” he said.

2947," you. Apple doesn’t want its device to be the primary monitoring tool for people who have a medical condition that puts them at a higher risk of strokes and other potentially fatal outcomes. Instead, it wants to help people who don’t know they have it take the first step to get a diagnosis: About a quarter of the 2.3 million people who have atrial fibrillation won’t experience any symptoms. You’ll then get a notification about everything that the Apple Watch does not do. It won’t track heart attacks, help you get off meds or replace your doctor, among other things. Apple, but it clearly doesn’t want users to make important medical decisions on their own. Finally, you’ll get some information about what to do if you are experiencing an irregular heart rhythm that might be atrial fibrillation. In short, see your doctor. You can also set up high and low heart rate notifications to the parameters of your choosing. I’ll receive an alert from Apple Watch if my heart rate falls to 40 beats per minute or as high as 120 beats per minute. Taking an ECG measurement is also fairly easy. First, set up the ECG app on the watch, which again requires a date of birth. Apple also provides some instructions on how to take a reading by placing a finger on the digital crown of the Apple Watch. You don’t need to hold down on the crown, just touch it and stay still. Apple then explains the different results users might get. The most common — and the reading I got every time I took an ECG — is “sinus rhythm.” That basically means the heart is beating in a uniform pattern, and the Apple Watch hasn’t detected an irregularity in your heart rhythm with its sensor. An important caveat: It doesn’t screen for every condition, and you should still seek medical care if you’re experiencing symptoms. You might also see atrial fibrillation, low or high heart rate, or an inconclusive result, which might be because you moved around too much or you need to tighten your Apple Watch around the wrist. The ECG sensor incorporates new electrodes built into both the back crystal and the digital crown, which are designed to measure your heart’s electrical signal if you’re using the device correctly. Once you’re ready to take a reading with your Apple Watch, hold down a finger on the digital crown",error,513

The Echo Plus has a smart home hub built in, which means you don’t need to buy a separate one to control thousands of smart household products like light bulbs, outlets and door locks, even when you’re not at home. Finally, it’s really easy to use and manage from an iPhone or Android phone and works equally as well on both platforms. And you can add all sorts of stuff, including a smart microwave with support for Alexa, or an Echo Sub to add more bass to a regular Echo if you play lots of music. Amazon Echo Cons: Amazon says it doesn’t eavesdrop on the Echo microphones or spy through the cameras. However, it does have information on the commands you speak to Alexa. (You can delete them: Here’s a guide that explains how.) Amazon says it uses that data for “accuracy of the results provided to you and to improve our services,” which means it’s probably learning about you so it can better target products on Amazon to you. While Alexa can do a lot, you still need to go into the Alexa app to enable certain third party “skills.” So, if you want to play a game like “Trivial Pursuit” with Alexa or call an Uber, you’ll first need to open the app and install those skills.

2960,": You can get started with a Google Home Mini for $29 or spend up to $350 on a Google Home Max, which means there’s a price point that makes it attractive for everyone. The more you spend, the better speakers you get. I’ve always found the Google Assistant to be the smarter than Siri or Alexa, largely because it seems to understand what I’m saying the most accurately. Also, Google Assistant is really good at follow-up conversations. That means you can ask it the weather in New York City and then ask another related question without confusing it. The Google Home can play movies and music on TVs around your house that are equipped with a Chromecast, and like an Amazon Echo, it can serve as an in-home intercom for announcements. It’s also really good at multi-room music if you have several of them in your home, and can play different songs in each room. And it can do things like call restaurants and tell you about events on your calendar. The new Google Home Hub performs just as the Google Home products do, but also includes a screen. That means, like an Echo Show or Echo Spot, you can use it to view the steps in a recipe, watch YouTube TV, browse photo albums, see security cameras around your house and more. It costs $129, which is cheaper than an Amazon Echo Show. Google Home Cons: There aren’t as many form factors available to choose from as there are from the Echo. You can choose between the Google Home Mini, the Google Home, the Google Home Hub and the Google Home Max. If you don’t like any of them, you can buy a product from a partner like Lenovo. Unlike the Amazon Echo Plus, Google Home products don’t have a built-in smart hub, so you can’t control things like Philips Hue bulbs (or ZigBee and Z-Wave-ready smart home products) without installing a separate hub or bridge that lets those gadgets talk to Google. You can get away with products that don’t require a hub, though, like LifX smart bulbs, and there are plenty of other gadgets, like smart outlets, that support Google Assistant. It isn’t as confusing as it sounds, but some folks might find it easier to just buy an Echo Plus that includes a hub from the start.

2970,", President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a phone call in which a mutual emphasis on the importance of trade was stressed. Asked in the company’s November 1 earnings call whether Apple had any plans to diversify the supply chain given trade and geopolitical events, Cook said the company was not over-reliant on China. “If you look at the products that we are manufacturing, they’re manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from US market, from Japan to Korean to many countries. Great content from China as well. There are many hands in the products, the vast majority of R&D is in the U.S.,” he said according to a transcript of the call online, adding that he was still optimistic a solution to trade tensions could be found. Needless to say, by the end of November, Trump told the Wall Street Journalist he was not likely to delay an increase in the tariff rate (from 10 to 25 percent) on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on January 1. Trump also suggested he could put a 10 percent tariff on Apple iPhones and laptops imported from China. As Apple announced its results for the fiscal third quarter, the company said it had seen 19 percent year-on-year growth in China (but a 29 percent dip quarter over quarter), it also announced it had opened its 50th retail store there in the quarter. Asked again about the impact of the trade tensions, Cook again said China continued to see growth but he expanded on trade tariffs too, saying that they could damage economic growth. However, Cook said the company was evaluating a proposal to slap tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods -- this proposal (which was enacted in September 2018 by Trump) came after the U.S. decided to slap a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion in Chinese goods in June 2018. Announcing Apple’s second quarter results, the company said it had seen 21 percent year-on-year growth in Greater China, the company’s “strongest growth rate from that segment in ten quarters,” according to CFO Luca Maestri. Revenue had dropped from $17.9 billion in the region in the first quarter to $13 billion in the second quarter, however, equating to a 27 percent decline. Asked about the threat of a brewing trade war between the U.S. and China, Tim Cook appeared sanguine, saying: Apple reports its first quarter earnings for 2018, announcing an 11 percent growth in revenue, year",error,513

While we are cutting AAPL estimates and price target, to us this speaks more about why it is too early to get more +ve on semis. Apple cited the majority of its sales miss from China which last quarter represented 18% of the company’s total sales which we estimate is now closer to 10-12%. While our financial model was below consensus we again lower our model and target price to $170 from $200 based on this news. In this report we show our scenario analysis which can help answer How Low Can Apple Stock Go? We do not expect much positive news until after earnings slated for late January and even then the focus will be how low can sales go (-5% y/y in December and we project –2% y/y in March) and while bulls will cite stock buyback and low valuation trading at 11x F12M PE we don’t expect any rally in the shares in the near term until consensus get materially reset lower and trade wars get resolved. The bottom line is that we are late (obviously), but we can no longer recommend AAPL. Fears about iPhone have been confirmed, uncertainty about the severity and duration of iPhone troubles will linger, and the other shoe is about to drop on Services growth, particularly for its highest margin drivers. What we want to learn more about on the FY1Q19 earnings call is: 1) causes and longterm implications (including brand damage) of the precipitous China slowdown during December; 2) how much friction AAPL’s aggressive pricing strategy is causing; and, 3) the impact of trade politics on the business results of AAPL and other global US companies. Last night Apple delivered a bombshell negative preannouncement that will be a defining moment for Cook & Co. for years to come. While the Street had been anticipating softness in the December quarter and around March guidance given a slew of negative iPhone XS/XR data points coming out of the Asia supply chain over the past few months, the magnitude of the top-line miss (~8%) with China demand the culprit was jaw dropping in our opinion and will heavily weigh on shares accordingly.

But critics, including tech companies, have decried the tariffs as an indirect tax on Americans that could slow growth and even threaten an economic recession. Trump tweet tariff man Apple itself sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in September, warning that proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would affect its product sales. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Lighthizer has told friends and associates that more tariffs on China may be necessary in order to avoid striking a subpar trade deal with Beijing. If the U.S. does apply more tariffs, Apple’s big-ticket items could be severely hurt, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an ex-undersecretary of Commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration. “It’s created a lot of uncertainty,” Reinsch said, “because that would cover iPhones and laptops and it would cover them in a very significant way. That has caused a lot of anxiety in the industry.” Apple is no outlier in its industry. Each of the five FAANG stocks fell into correction territory in November, collectively wiping out more than $1 trillion in market value from their recent highs over the summer. Even before entering the White House — and even while using their products — Trump was critical of tech companies. In 2013, Trump complained in a tweet that Apple “must go to a larger screen now--asap!” After saying he sold his Apple stock in 2014, Trump said the company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, “is spinning in his grave — Apple has lost both vision and momentum — must move fast to get magic back!” Fast forward to September 2018, when Trump warned that his retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports could raise Apple’s prices, and urged the company to “start building new plants now” in the U.S. Trump tweet Apple prices may increase Meanwhile Trump has targeted Amazon CEO Bezos’ e-retail behemoth with even more venom.

2975," “I believe on Nov. 1, the president’s tone changed towards a trade deal. It’s not a subtle change. It’s very direct. He was talking about tariffs, tariffs, tariffs, and then all of a sudden he was talking about doing a great deal.” On Dec. 1, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a cease-fire in the trade war, holding off on any further tariffs until March 1 so negotiators could seek a deal. Cesar Rojas, Citigroup global economist, said he sees an opportunity for a deal now though there’s no guarantee one will be reached. “There is a window of opportunity for the U.S. and China to come to a deal,” he said. “Growth is moderating in China, equity markets have been falling in the U.S. and China and this basically opens a window of opportunity. This may close soon.” Rojas said the U.S. economy is still strong, giving it more leverage against China, where its stimulus has so far failed to stem weakening. But that should change, and China could stabilize as the U.S. growth weakens later in the year, shifting the advantage to China. There could be a scenario where the March 1 deadline passes without new tariffs. “Even if there is no tariff increase, we describe this situation as tariff limbo. This uncertainty is having affect on the economic decisisions which is already having an impact,” he said. Stocks were already weak Thursday after Apple’s warning but dropped even more when the ISM data signaled that investors’ fears about a slowdown may be realized. “Up until now most of the bad news was out of China. Now the story is we’re vulnerable and we’re going to get hurt too,” said Art Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow closed Thursday down 2.8 percent, or 660.02 points, at 22,686.22. “You look at things like the new orders data, which has been trending lower not just in the U.S. but globally. That is reflecting weaker growth expectations by manufacturers in the U.S. and part of those are attributed to trade policy tensions,” said Gapen. Economist said the tightening of financial conditions from a falling stock market could be a factor in the ISM. “",error,513
2975,"That could be part of it but the stock market is also going down due to concerns about global growth, profitability, protectionism. I don’t think you can separate those things out,” Gapen said. In an unusual warning Wednesday, Apple said its fiscal first-quarter revenue would be $84 billion, down from the $89 to $93 billion it previously expected. It blamed the shortfall on a weaker Chinese economy and lower-than-expected iPhone revenue, “primarily in Greater China.” Apple also blamed upgrades to new iPhone model in other countries that were not as strong as expected.  Clifton said what investors are trying to discern now is how much of Apple’s problems are the Chinese economy, the iPhone upgrade cycle and how much is a possible boycott of U.S. goods. “There may be some consumer backlash to American companies, a form of nationalism,” said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. But he said there are many things at work with iPhone sales, including a weaker upgrade cycle and the macro picture of a weaker China. The U.S. has been cracking down on Chinese telecom companies ZTE and Huawei for suspected cyber espionage, and could still extradite Huawei’s CFO who is under arrest in Canada. Clifton said he expects to see other companies follow Apple, now that it has given them “cover” to blame China’s economy. Some companies have already pointed to China, while others, like Nike have not seen an impact. But Tiffany, for one, said its sales were impacted by softer spending from Chinese tourists in Hong Kong and New York. According to Coresight Research, China’s retail sales grew 8.1 percent in November, the slowest pace in 15 years. Some economists said the ISM data also reflects the decline in the stock market, denting confidence and causing manufacturers to pull back. But some is also trade, as reflected in comments by companies in the survey. “The perception is at least a portion of that is going to be due to trade,” said Clifton. “There’s no fighting the narrative itself. That’s why I think it could accelerate the progress that’s being made in these talks. I think they’re much further along than anyone anticipates. I think the process has been going on for a year. They understand they were going to have a deal on Dec. 1,",error,513

He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems’ founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer’s riposte? “Let’s not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn’t want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost.” But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer’s call. In it, he wrote: “If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that’s something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients’ data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so.” Still, for Cramer, that doesn’t strike Apple off the list of “ideal” partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, and Apple’s trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. “One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic — yes, if Judy would sell — or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,” he said. “There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple’s shareholders, and",error,513

Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren’t many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. “In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It’s been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it’s favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,” she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. “I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,” she said. “In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.” The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1.

In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. “When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating.

Click here to watch his full interview. Cramer often tells investors not to fall in love with their stocks, because getting too close to their holdings can cloud their judgment. Last week, that got taken to task when Align Technology reported. “Even though the numbers weren’t that great, the stock actually rallied after initially getting hit. Normally, when I see a stock go higher on seemingly bad news, that tells me that we’ve arrived at a bottom because there’s no one left to sell. That’s not the case this time,” Cramer warned. “If you still own Align Technology, I need you to listen to me: I think you should actually unload some of your position, because I do not like where I think this company could be headed.” Cramer’s biggest qualm with the Invisalign maker? Competition, specifically from lower-cost rivals taking advantage of Align Technology’s expired patents.  “Look, Align Technology has made many of our viewers a lot of money over the years. But an Align with competitors is a totally different story from an Align with no competitors,” he explained. And with the stock trading at 35 times next year’s earnings estimates — a concerning multiple if you don’t think Align can meet the guidance, and Cramer doesn’t — this dentistry play is looking more and more risky to the “Mad Money” host. “Here’s the bottom line for a stock that we have pushed forever: Align Technology was one of the best growth stocks around — it had a superior product and the stock deserved to soar — but now, Align has a bunch of new competitors and that makes this a much less compelling story,” he said. “So, if you own this one, I say take advantage of this recent strength and ring the darned register.” In Cramer’s lightning round, he shared his rapid-fire responses to callers’ stock questions: Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc.: “It is one of the few regional banks that I actually feel good about.

We’ve also seen no reason why faster data speeds will drastically improve our experience outside downloads. When LTE phones came out, we could suddenly place video calls and stream music. That made them must-haves. What is 5G going to add that will make consumers really need a phone that supports it? We saw a similar innovation lag with the new iPhones. The screens got bigger, the processors got faster, and the cameras were slightly improved. All great features! Millions of people still bought them, but fewer than historically and not in markets where Apple needs to make up ground, like China. If anything, all I heard were complaints about how the new iPhones cost too much. Apple’s fight in China has had an adverse affect on its iPhone revenues, with shipments crashing nearly 20 percent there because of expensive prices. But at least Apple is on the map in China, where it’s the fourth largest seller of phones. Samsung isn’t even in the top 5. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and other local brands are taking advantage of Apple and Samsung’s missteps in the market by selling affordable phones with strong local brand names. The strength of the U.S. dollar is hurting Apple, and it’s probably not helping Samsung either. To be fair, Samsung has more affordable budget phones that it sells in these markets, but those, too, seemed to have failed to gain traction in China, or at least enough to bump it into the top 5 vendors there. And the new ones aren’t going to help. These mistakes have material effects on Apple and Samsung, the global phone leaders by market share. Apple’s shipments fell 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter over the same year-ago quarter, according to Canalys. Samsung’s fell 5.3 percent. Huawei saw 47.3 percent growth. Oppo, another Chinese brand, saw 20.6 percent growth. IDC published similar numbers earlier this month. It said the global smartphone market “is a mess right now” and noted that shipments declined down to 2014 volumes, marking the worst year for smartphone shipments ever. Samsung’s shipments declined 11.5 percent during the quarter, according to IDC, while Samsung’s fell off 5.5 percent. IDC also said consumers",error,513

Or, if you have a new Galaxy S10 phone, you can turn on the wireless power share feature to charge the battery simply by placing the Galaxy Buds case on the back of the phone. It’s super convenient if you don’t have an outlet. But you shouldn’t worry about battery life too much. Samsung promises — and it seemed accurate in my tests — about six hours of battery life from the buds plus an additional seven hours of battery life from the case they charge in. And 15 minutes of charging gets you 1.7 hours of playback, so you don’t need to charge for long. Phone calls sounded good, too. I called my editor while I walked down the hall and he said I sounded clear. I could hear him from his desk phone just fine, too. But the signal did drop off after I walked about 20 feet from the Galaxy S10 they were paired to. I liked that I could tap the side to activate Google Assistant and ask it anything, from the weather to placing a phone call to my colleague. AirPods only work with Siri, which does both of those things but isn’t generally as smart as Google Assistant, which I was also use to play music from third-party services like Spotify. The Galaxy Buds also have an ambient noise feature, which means you can tap one of the buds to lower the music volume, allowing you to temporarily hear your surroundings more. This worked OK. The music got really soft, but I found it was just as easy to pause the song entirely. I really don’t have a lot of complaints with the Galaxy Buds. At $129, they’re $30 cheaper than AirPods and, to me, are the perfect alternative for Android users. My biggest complaint is that while you can see the battery life of each individual earbud, you can’t see how much charge is left in the Galaxy Buds case. There’s only an indicator light on front that’s green when there’s a good charge and red when there isn’t. AirPods are able to show you how much battery percentage is left in each component, including the case, and you can see it right on your iPhone. This isn’t a huge deal, but I do wish I had a better idea of how much battery",error,513

The headphones automatically pair with a smartphone via bluetooth when a USB cable hidden in the cord connecting them is inserted into the device, Huawei said. They can also be charged this way, using the phone’s battery life. Magnets in the FreeLace buds mean they can also be attached to each other when no longer in use. Peter Richardson, research director for tech strategies at Counterpoint Research, said the Chinese smartphone manufacturer’s phones come with a “joy factor” because of their cameras that can’t be found in Apple’s iPhone. “I went from using the Mate 20 Pro to iPhone and the number of pictures I took just dropped dramatically,” he told CNBC. “And the only thing I can pin it down to is it’s just not very enjoyable using the iPhone camera.” He said the P30 Pro’s telephoto lens, designed to take long-distance shots, was “just extraordinary,” noting it’s often an area of “weakness” for smartphones.

3056," failure), shaking up a sclerotic corporate culture — all these can be achieved by partnering with young companies, provided they’re the right partners and the enterprise host doesn’t crush the relationship. The study also revealed why start-up companies enter into partnerships. Their goals are usually fairly tangible, such as gaining access to resources (23%), obtaining funding (21%), driving sales (20%) or getting entry to new customers or markets (15%). These partnerships often delivered expected pluses, such as stimulating growth (85%) or making money (75%), but they also helped in other ways, such as giving them credibility (91%) and teaching them new ways of thinking and working (65-66%). Whatever drives legacy companies to form these alliances, whether out of desperate necessity or to solve a particular problem, there’s a surprising halo effect wrought by successful partnerships — the new thinking it generates, the new energy, the excitement of a new relationship, the different conversations, the role modeling, the optimism. So what works? How do you set up and conduct the best kinds of partnerships? Here are the four success strategies. 1. To find a great partner, let happenstance guide you. Sounds stupid, right? Wouldn’t it just be better to form a search committee or design an algorithm to screen for the best candidates to provide the right jigsaw puzzle piece? Nope. Having an overarching strategic purpose is indispensable. So is a proactive approach to looking for partners: 68% of surveyed legacy companies revealed they had somebody within the company whose job was to pursue partnership opportunities. But too organized an approach can be a liability; serendipity is often the best guide. No company is better at capitalizing on unexpected collisions than Motorola Solutions, the spun-off half of Motorola that provides technology to emergency, safety and utility crews, security and law enforcement and transportation companies. (The other half, of course, marketed mobile handsets and went to Google, then to Lenovo.) Motorola Solutions has developed what it calls Hunting Grounds, four or five areas of focus for new ideas and approaches that change with strategic priorities. The Hunting Grounds attract a lot of disparate “trappers” at Motorola Solutions: its venture-capital arm with over 200 investments since its first deal in 1999; senior executives who are encouraged to visit with entrepreneurial clusters in key cities; its incubator in Israel; and employees within its own new walls in Chicago (the company relocated from Schaumberg in the summer of 2016). 2.

3056," to win? Let the start-up run the show. Isn’t that like giving the keys to your vintage Alfa Romeo to your 17-year-old son? Older companies want to control everything — especially the key decisions in a partnership. And why not? They have the experience, the resources... and the hubris to really screw it up. According to the Global Partnership Study, 75% of partnerships that made start-up leaders the key decision-makers were successful versus 62% of those where the established company called the shots. (Shared decision-making is the least productive arrangement, with a 56% success rate.) 3. Defer to the talent and tools of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Partnerships fall apart for all kinds of reasons, though the leading candidates, according to our study, are unmet goals and culture clash. Failure, despite the rhetoric that failure is endemic to innovation, is off-limits at most companies because it suggests weakness, fallibility. Not at Procter & Gamble (full disclosure: I was the previous global marketing officer at P&G). P&G harnessed the knowledge of Bionic, a firm that installs a start-up ecosystem in large corporations. Bionic’s Growth OS model drove down the cost of failure and encouraged P&G to run its R&D and partnership investments with a venture capitalist mindset. P&G is now making multiple bets on innovative solutions, focused not only in existing customer markets but new and emerging “total addressable problems.” Most of these new solutions won’t make it, but a few will, and big-time. Bionic’s approach is to push for reframing learning around validation, emphasizing the concept of “productive failure” — the faster you learn from your mistakes, the faster you discover the “commercial truth.” Because in the end, behaviors don’t lie. 4. Win over skeptics with demos, not discussions. According to the study, two-thirds of established companies said start-ups had been instrumental in improving their organizational culture. But achieving that scale of change requires overcoming institutional inertia, doubt, fear — even undermining from within. How? By dramatically demonstrating the lasting benefits of a radical new approach. Seeing — in convincing detail — is believing.

This is one of my new favorite features, since it lets me use my PS4 controller on the road while streaming games from my PS4 at home. But the controllers also work with some games in the iTunes App Store. To set it up, do this: Here’s another hidden trick: You can long press inside Control Center for even more options. My favorite is using this for connecting to a specific Wi-Fi network without having to open settings. It also works for Bluetooth devices. Just do this: IOS 13.1, a small update that rolled out this past week, now lets you share your ETA with friends or family from Apple Maps. So, if you’re driving somewhere, they can follow along with you on the map and know that you’re safe and when you’ll arrive. To use it, do this: You can now make your Memoji look more like you. These are the fun animated videos and still photos you can send to people and are basically just emojis that are made to represent your personality. To edit your Memoji, do this: I use Apple Photos and Google Photos to back up my pictures. But I really love the new “Day” view in Apple Photos, which shows the best pictures and video clips I took on a certain day. Apple will show some pictures it thinks are important, like portraits of people. And video clips are played, too, making the gallery feel alive. Here’s how to see it: Portrait mode was launched a couple of years ago to let you take professional-looking pictures. Apple blurs the background using a “bokeh” effect. There are a few different portrait mode options that change the lighting in your pictures, but a new one in iOS 13 is called “high-key light mono.” It takes a black-and-white picture and makes the background completely white. It can make even a sloppy blogger look cool, as the photo above shows. Here’s how to take your own high-key light mono portrait: Apple has a new “optimized battery charging” option in iOS 13 that will keep your battery healthy so that it doesn’t age as quickly. This doesn’t mean more battery life right now, but it means your battery might not need to be replaced as quickly. It will stay in tip-",error,513
3058," a new interface with more detailed maps and 3D buildings, flight tracking, better voice guidance and a higher contrast street layout that makes visual navigation easier. Some of this is only available on your phone, but I found the directions to be excellent while driving, though Google Maps sometimes still gets traffic better. One time, for example, Apple told me it would only take me 45 minutes to get home in traffic, and it took more like an hour and fifteen minutes. Google’s better at the ETA still, I think. Apple Maps also doesn’t call out speed traps like Waze, but it’s finally good enough that you won’t mind using it. Plus, Apple doesn’t store your location information like Google does, so there’s a privacy bonus. You’re more free to use your phone while it’s connected to CarPlay now, too.  Here’s what it used to be like: You’re in the car with your friend using CarPlay for directions. You ask your passenger to queue a song on Spotify. As soon as they leave the Google Maps or Apple Maps app, your navigation screen disappears and Spotify opens on your infotainment screen. Or, you arrive to pick someone up and go to text them while the car is parked. As soon as you open Messages, Siri starts blurting out your messages. There was no way to have a parked driver or passenger use Messages without the music pausing and Siri trying to blabber on until you hit the cancel button. It drove me nuts. That doesn’t happen anymore. Now, CarPlay is decoupled from the actual on-screen content of the iPhone. You can have a passenger queue songs, look up restaurants or send a text without losing your navigation display. It’s a major — and desperately needed — fix for CarPlay, and I love it. The freedom to use your phone and the Dashboard display are definitely the biggest changes, but CarPlay also gets a few more quality-of-life enhancements. While CarPlay has historically been black and gray, there’s now a Light Mode theme to change things up and make the experience brighter, which I like. Plus, Apple Music gets a new look that focuses on albums and is easier to navigate while on the move. Apple Calendar now supports CarPlay, too, so you can map out your day and navigate to locations that are stored in your appointments. Finally, Siri",error,513
3074," brand. You can still hear some stuff, like loud voices. There’s a neat “Passthrough Mode” that you can turn on by double tapping the side of the Echo Buds (the same control to switch to noise reduction mode), which amplifies the sounds outside. So, if you’re listening to music and turn on passthrough, you’ll be able to hear airplane gate announcements, people talking or cars driving on the road, which is nice if you’re a commuter. It works well, and I liked that you can adjust how loud passthrough is, so you can turn it all the way up to make sure you really do hear the outside world. Some headphones have similar options that don’t sound as clear. You can use the Echo Buds to access your phone’s voice assistant like Siri or Google Assistant, but I preferred sticking with Alexa. I liked how convenient it was to quickly ask Alexa to turn on the lights in my house, order soap from Amazon, play a book from Audible and stream music from one of a bunch of services including Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify and Sirius XM. Alexa was also able to hear me accurately most of the time, which meant it knew who I was trying to call when I asked it to call my editor. Call quality was on a par with AirPods. My editor said I sounded good and clear enough for him. I didn’t have any issues with the buds dropping a connection during another hourlong phone call, and liked that I could turn on noise reduction so that I could hear the other end more clearly. One person said that I sounded “tinny,” though, and that they could tell I wasn’t speaking into my phone. Battery life was about what I expect from wireless buds. Amazon advertises five hours per charge and says the case gives you up to 20 hours when you charge up in between uses. After an hour phone call, the buds dropped to 74% and 88%, respectively. It’s weird that one lost more battery life than the other. Amazon includes three different tip sizes and three different optional wings that help the buds stay in your ears. Most people I know like their AirPods, but I’ve heard from several who complain that they won’t stay in their ears. The Echo Buds are good at that. But I found that they’re a little uncomfortable to wear",error,513
3074," for a long period of time, even after I tried all of the tip sizes. I wore them for most of a work day, walking around my house during calls and sitting at my desk listening to music. AirPods aren’t perfectly comfortable either, but I thought the Echo Buds would be a little better since they have softer tips. The case is bigger than the AirPods case, and it feels and looks like cheap plastic. It also uses older microUSB technology for charging. That’s not a big deal, but it also means you need to carry a microUSB cord with you instead of a newer USB-C cable that most modern gadgets use. Also, the controls on the sides of the Echo Buds can be a little finicky. The double-tap input to activate passthrough or noise reduction works fine, but sometimes I had to hold the side really long to bring up Siri, if it activated at all. I could just bring up Alexa by saying “Alexa,” but I don’t always like talking to myself in public. Sometimes the Alexa app, which is used to control your in-home Amazon products and also the Echo Buds, can be a little weird, too. You can use it to start audible books, for example, but not Spotify playlists. Instead, if you want Spotify, you need to open the Spotify app, even if they’re listed in the Alexa app as recently played. But I do like that the app makes it really easy to pair the Echo Buds. You just open the case and tap them when they pop up in the app. Finally, if you add on the wings that help keep the Echo Buds in your ears, they can sometimes prevent the Echo Buds case from closing completely until you either jam it closed or adjust the wing so that it’s not blocking the case cover. I think Amazon could have designed this a little better so the buds fit more seamlessly. Despite some of the drawbacks, the Echo Buds are priced well at $129, and I think they’re a good option for folks who haven’t bought or don’t care for AirPods. They’re an especially good option for Android users, maybe even the best option. I really like the noise reduction option, that they last long, sounded good enough on phone calls and worked really well with Alexa. I wish Amazon built a better case and that they were more comfortable, though",error,513
3082," use them on your other Apple devices, like an iPad or MacBook. No additional pairing is required. Just look for it in your list of Bluetooth devices. Music and movies sounded really good and nicely balanced. Beats is known for pumping up the lows (bass) in its products, but the company said it’s not really doing that anymore. Instead, it’s focusing on a more balanced sound so you can hear the mids and highs just as clearly. They sound awesome — just as good as my older Bose QC35s — and I think a bit better than even AirPods Pro. That’s probably because there’s more room in them for hardware. I found the Beats Pro to be comfortable most of the time, but when I gave them to my wife for another leg of our flight, she said they got uncomfortable and hurt her ears a little. In general, though, the cups are soft, and I thought they were fine during long periods of listening. I like a bunch of other features about the Beats Solo Pro that show attention to detail. They’re made of nice, strong metal, for example, instead of plastic like the Solo3. They turn on when you unfold them and turn off when you fold them shut and place them back in the included soft carrying case. There’s Lightning charging, too, instead of the older microUSB technology, so you can use the same cable to charge them that you do for your iPhone. And the battery life is great. They last much longer than AirPods Pro. They’re rated for up to 22 hours of battery with noise cancellation or transparency mode on, or up to 40 hours with those features off. That’s plenty for two flights across the country without having to worry about plugging them in, and I’ve been using them for about a week occasionally without having to charge them up. Also, I like that Apple’s H1 chip lets you speak to Siri. I don’t often talk to myself in public but was glad I could ask Siri to call someone, bring up directions to my parked car with voice-guided walking navigation as I listened to music, and to start my playlist “Todd’s Good Tunes 2019.” Noise cancellation is good for most things, but like the AirPods Pro, it didn’t feel as strong as my Bose QC35 headphones. Bose has always been a go-to for frequent travelers",error,513
3099," example — Huawei could find its HarmonyOS a tough sell. “It won’t be easy for Huawei to build up a library of premier applications outside of China, as many of them rely on Google for things like digital rights management, location, payment, and notification services,” Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at IDC, told CNBC. Huawei was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. “Developers oftentimes have to be selective on which projects they spend their time on, and a key factor in that decision-making is whether there is enough of a critical mass in the user base to justify the time and effort spent in porting applications over,” Ma said. Huawei’s HMS is similar to Google Mobile Services and offers developers kits that can be used to integrate things like location services into apps. The Chinese firm said there are 60,000 apps using so-called HMS Core services, but it did not break down what countries or regions those are in.  Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, called the number of apps “limited” and said Huawei is still missing major apps.  “Outside of China, it will be struggle as most of the marquee applications come from big profile U.S. developers — Netflix, Facebook properties (Instagram, WhatsApp), Google apps, etc — which are obviously banned to collaborate with Huawei,” Shah said. “So overall, without marquee developers on board, it’s going to be a tough sell.” Indeed, a number of major apps that are important in international markets are not on Huawei’s app store, called the AppGallery. Users cannot download any Google apps or Facebook-owned services. Netflix or Spotify are not available either.  However, it does have the Amazon Shopping app, as well as video-sharing app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance.  Huawei has expressed its desire to get Google apps onto the AppGallery. “We hope Google services can be available through our AppGallery, just like how Google services are available through Apple’s App Store,” Eric Xu, rotating chairman at Huawei said in an interview with CNBC in March.  But this will be a challenge, according to Ma.  “Legal considerations aside, I find it highly unlikely that Google would publish its own apps into the AppGallery, as they have the same hooks into its services as third parties do.

3126,", New York, Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley — were the most active areas for data center construction in the United States. Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing. Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people. “The market is very big because the demand is huge,” said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. “Data centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.” Lucrative tax incentives are the rare area of data center development that has come under criticism. Iowa last year awarded Apple $208 million in tax breaks to build a $1.3 billion center in rural Waukee that would employ 50 people. “The big tech companies are getting huge tax breaks to build things they would build anyway,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group in Washington. “The cost to taxpayers is enormous for data centers that create very few permanent jobs.” Oregon’s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year. Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape. Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent “franchise” fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook’s and Apple’s centers consume nearly $",error,513
3126,"40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010. When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville’s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently. “We were a cowboy and timber town,” said Steve Forrester, Prineville’s city manager and a former sawmill executive. “We went from ‘I got to go feed my cows’ to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.” Once-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country. The data centers also are changing the region’s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon’s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs. In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages. “Our unadjusted employment was 24 percent,” she said. “So we did whatever we had to do to change that.” When seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements — available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers — Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air. Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and",error,513

Apple says the joint venture does not mean that China has any kind of “backdoor” into user data and that Apple alone – not its Chinese partner – will control the encryption keys. But Chinese customers will notice some differences from the start: their iCloud accounts will now be co-branded with the name of the local partner, a first for Apple. And even though Chinese iPhones will retain the security features that can make it all but impossible for anyone, even Apple, to get access to the phone itself, that will not apply to the iCloud accounts. Any information in the iCloud account could be accessible to Chinese authorities who can present Apple with a legal order. Apple said it will only respond to valid legal requests in China, but China’s domestic legal process is very different than that in the U.S., lacking anything quite like an American “warrant” reviewed by an independent court, Chinese legal experts said. Court approval isn’t required under Chinese law and police can issue and execute warrants. “Even very early in a criminal investigation, police have broad powers to collect evidence,” said Jeremy Daum, an attorney and research fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center in Beijing. ”(They are) authorized by internal police procedures rather than independent court review, and the public has an obligation to cooperate.” Guizhou - Cloud Big Data and China’s cyber and industry regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Guizhou provincial government said it had no specific comment. There are few penalties for breaking what rules do exist around obtaining warrants in China. And while China does have data privacy laws, there are broad exceptions when authorities investigate criminal acts, which can include undermining communist values, “picking quarrels” online, or even using a virtual private network to browse the Internet privately. Apple says the cryptographic keys stored in China will be specific to the data of Chinese customers, meaning Chinese authorities can’t ask Apple to use them to decrypt data in other countries like the United States. Privacy lawyers say the changes represent a big downgrade in protections for Chinese customers. “The U.S. standard, when it’s a warrant and when it’s properly executed, is the most privacy-protecting standard,” said Camille Fischer of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Apple has given its Chinese users",error,513
3160," the proposal. The company argues that it already has “much broader” diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made “steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities.” The proposed policy, Apple concludes, “is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity.” Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn’t good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple’s leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it’ll hurt Apple’s business in the years to come. “In the long term, this will affect them,” he says. “The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else.” Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a “reputational risk” by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its “search light as wide as possible” for new engineers and executives. That’ll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are “basically irreplaceable.” Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple’s decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company’s efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge.” For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that’s led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to “to get ahead of carbon pricing;” on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. “You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues,” Tomaino says",error,513
3160,". “Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward,” says Tomaino. “With Apple and diversity, the case is clear.” Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a “fiscally conservative, socially moderate person,” clarifies that he doesn’t want this turned into “a social justice warrior issue,” and says he’s simply “looking at things in black and white in terms of money.” He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with ”#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. “I know it sounds as if it’s socially progressive, but it’s not a socially progressive issue,” he says. “Money talks, okay?” Maldonado says Apple’s leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. “I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person,” he says. “I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership,” he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That’s racism plain and simple. That’s all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company’s 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn’t happy with the answer. “Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two back people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity,” Maldonado says. “Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as ‘here’s tokenism,’ and he didn’t seem to accept that.” Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple’s 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That",error,513
3172," until later in the year, but CFRA analyst Zino suggested that may change if details President Trump’s plans to allow low-tax repatriation of offshore corporate cash holdings become clear — it was not presented with any detail in the tax reform overview provided by the White House last week. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company has allocated several billion dollars of its offshore holdings for buybacks as soon as the company can move the money into the U.S. without paying U.S. corporate taxes on it. Most market watchers, noting that as much as three-fourths of cash repatriated during a tax holiday on foreign profits while George W. Bush was president — even though it was technically prohibited by Congress — expect Apple to pay out much more. “They could reduce the share count another 20 percent if they get the repatriation effect,” Zino said. Apple could use its massive cash hoard to buy Netflix and Tesla, and still have plenty of cash left over, noted a Wall Street Journal report on Monday that estimated the cash at $250 billion. Some market watchers speculate that Apple could also offer a special dividend payment if repatriation of cash occurs. More from ETF Strategist:The death of active management in one articleTesla’s ETF problemPlaying Elon Musk’s energy agenda through ETFs The company has been returning capital to holders of shares since 2012, when it instituted a buyback and dividend in response to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. Apple’s initial dividend was the largest “dividend increase” in the S&P 500 ever, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. About 94 percent of its $246 million in cash and securities is held overseas, as the company uses most domestic profits for reinvestment and return to shareholders, supplemented by money the company has borrowed for buybacks. Apple raised its quarterly dividend, currently 57 cents, by a nickel each of the past two years, while buybacks have reduced Apple’s shares outstanding by almost 20 percent, worth about $150 billion at today’s share price. The amount Apple spends on dividends, about $12 billion last fiscal year, has been nearly unchanged because the higher payout is offset by the shrinking number of shares, Zino said. The company’s yield since 2012 has fluctuated between about its current level and about 2.4 percent, fluctuating with Apple’s stock price.

That could give Apple an opportunity to beef up its services business further through expanding its content library, said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “To do a mega deal, like [buying] Disney, certainly getting the cash back in the U.S. would be a nice positive,”  Daryanani told “Power Lunch” on Monday. “Now listen, there’s reason to believe that the reason that Apple hasn’t done a deal in the past few years isn’t because they don’t have the money, but because they believe their old strategy works into content.”  To that end, Apple’s tax expectations will be in focus. In January, the tech giant forecast a tax rate of 26 percent for the March quarter.  Former Apple analyst turned VC Gene Munster wrote that Apple’s earnings likely a “non-event,” as investors focus on what the future holds for the next iPhone, which Munster calls the iPhone X.  “There appears to be little risk from the Mar-17 results or Jun-17 guidance that would change iPhone X anticipation,” Munster said. “Fast forwarding to the fall, shares are setting up to enter a range-bound period as investors playing the iPhone X trade will likely unwind positions.” But least one part of Apple’s guidance, its gross margins, might be of note, RBC’s Daryanani said. The company said in January it expects gross margin between 38 and 39 percent for the March quarter.

3196," a user’s vision. Why should Apple enter the space? After all, Google Glass got a lot of backlash for its awkward design and from onlookers who were afraid of the attached camera, which could be turned on at will. Snap’s similar camera glasses, Spectacles, introduced last year, have also fared poorly -- the company just had to write off almost $40 million in unsold inventory. But I think Apple has learned from the mistakes of its predecessors, and might not even have to include the ability to take photos or videos -- just leave those tasks to a smartphone. Instead, Apple’s smart glasses could be used for guides: providing directions as you walk around a city. Or maybe more information about the restaurant that you’re looking at (Yelp reviews, for example). Or perhaps Apple glasses could be used in the enterprise, as Google Glass has been used to allow engineers more accuracy during assembly. What if you could pull up notes on Apple’s glasses during a business meeting? Or receive and send emails and messages, likely via voice, without breaking a stride. Or what about health? As Apple continues to expand its focus in the area, what if doctors could use rOS-powered glasses to better diagnose patients by comparing a one symptom to an entire database of ailments in just seconds? What if I could look down at a rash on my leg and know it was poison ivy and not a reaction to something I ate? Apple could potentially generate revenue in two or more ways from its glasses. First, on the sale of the glasses themselves and, second, on the apps that it could sell that were developed specifically for the rOS software platform. I imagine wireless carriers would be happy to jump on board, too, since they’d need some sort of data connection to provide all of this real-time information. Does this signal Apple’s intentions to move entirely away from the iPhone? I don’t think so. The iPhone will likely remain -- at least for now -- the place where we go to watch movies, play games, and interact with software that isn’t placed on top of the world we live in. Instead, I foresee Apple’s glasses with rOS as a tool -- a whole new kind of tech product that helps us understand more about the world around us and how to interact with specific items that we might not be trained to use.

3204," been used by over 500 outside researchers to recruit 3 million participants. Since it was released in 2015, Apple Watch has always included a heart rate sensor. But to screen for atrial fibrillation, Apple needed to do more: It needed to monitor the heart’s rhythm.  To do that, the company used a combination of both hardware and software tools. It works by combining LED lights that flash hundreds of times each second and light-sensitive semiconductor devices to detect the quantity of blood flowing through the wrist. These sensors gather these signals from four points on the wrist. The software algorithms then look for patterns to isolate irregular heart rhythms.  If the Apple Watch picks up on a problem, those who participate in the study will get a notification and an offer of a free consultation, via a phone call or video, with a remote doctor. These virtual visits are provided by American Well, a privately held company. The doctor will run through some standard questions and suggest a visit to the emergency room for further tests, or send the subject a patch called an electrocardiogram or EKG, which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing atrial fibrillation. Longer-term, a company called Alivecor is developing an interchangeable Apple Watch band with an in-built EKG to detect atrial fibrillation and other conditions. It remains to be seen whether Apple will work with insurance partners to provide a discounted or free device to those who can’t afford an Apple Watch. It recently held meetings with Aetna to nail down a strategy to provide watches to millions of its members.  Because the study is based on a mobile device, anyone can sign up regardless of their proximity to a medical center. Williams described it as “a bit of a breakthrough in that it’s a virtual clinical trial,” which will be broadly available to a large population. That’s unique and will help dramatically increase the people who can participate in the study. But it also means the company will need to show that it isn’t sending healthy people to the hospital armed with data from an Apple Watch. That’s a big challenge, medical experts say, because testing or screening a healthy population always carries with it a risk of false positives. “We may all have a little of it, if we start looking for it,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and director of Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation.",error,513
3226," and its workforce, concentrated in three areas where Apple has had the greatest impact on job creation: direct employment by Apple, spending and investment with Apple’s domestic suppliers and manufacturers, and fueling the fast-growing app economy which Apple created with iPhone(R) and the App Store(R). Apple is already responsible for creating and supporting over 2 million jobs across the United States and expects to generate even more jobs as a result of the initiatives being announced today.Combining new investments and Apple’s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers -- an estimated $55 billion for 2018 -- Apple’s direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years, not including Apple’s ongoing tax payments, the tax revenues generated from employees’ wages and the sale of Apple products.Planned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of Apple’s direct contribution.“Apple is a success story that could only have happened in America, and we are proud to build on our long history of support for the US economy, ” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We believe deeply in the power of American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness. We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.“Apple, already the largest US taxpayer, anticipates repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion as required by recent changes to the tax law. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its kind ever made.Growing Apple’s US OperationsApple expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the US over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one. Apple already employs 84,000 people in all 50 states.The company plans to establish an Apple campus in a new location, which will initially house technical support for customers. The location of this new facility will be announced later in the year.Over $10 billion of Apple’s expanded capital expenditures will be investments in data centers across the US. Over the last decade, Apple has invested billions of dollars in data centers and co-located facilities in seven US states, including North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and a",error,513
3226," recently announced project in Iowa.Today, Apple is breaking ground on a new facility in downtown Reno, which will support its existing Nevada facilities.All of Apple’s US facilities, including offices, retail stores and data centers, are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources like solar, wind and micro-hydro power, which Apple generates or purchases from local projects. The new campus announced today will also be powered entirely by green energy.Investing in Apple’s Domestic Suppliers and Manufacturing PartnersBuilding on the initial success of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund announced last spring, Apple is increasing the size of the fund from $1 billion to $5 billion. The fund was established to support innovation among American manufacturers and help others establish a presence in the US. It is already backing projects with leading manufacturers in Kentucky and rural Texas.Apple works with over 9,000 American suppliers -- large and small businesses in all 50 states -- and each of Apple’s core products relies on parts or materials made in the US or provided by US-based suppliers.Preparing Students for the App EconomyApple, which has a 40-year history in education, also plans to accelerate its efforts across the US in support of coding education as well as programs focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM).The iOS app economy has created more than 1.6 million jobs in the US and generated $5 billion in revenue for American app developers in 2017. With demand for coding skills stronger than ever, today there are more than 500,000 unfilled programming-related positions across the country, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants qualified to fill them.(1)To address the coding skills gap and help prepare more people for jobs in software development, Apple created a powerful yet easy-to-learn coding language called Swift(TM), the free Swift Playgrounds(TM) app and a free curriculum, App Development with Swift, which are available to anyone and are already being used by millions of students at K-12 schools, summer camps and leading community colleges across the country. Over 100,000 students and teachers have also attended coding classes at Apple retail stores.Apple will expand these initiatives and add new programs to support teachers and teacher training. The company is also increasing funding for its ConnectED program, so students in historically underserved communities have a chance to learn app coding skills and enjoy other benefits of technology in the classroom.Apple revolutionized personal technology with",error,513
3233," last year. As of the quarter ending in December, Apple had 2.5 percent of India’s overall smartphone market, according to Counterpoint. More worrisome for Apple should be the models that are selling well in the nation. Even as the company doesn’t list the resurrected iPhone 6 (now with 32GB storage as the base model) and iPhone 5s on its India website, both the handsets have been among the top selling iPhone models in India in the recent quarters. Even in the premium smartphone segment where Apple operates, it is losing share to Samsung and OnePlus, Counterpoint said. Apple’s share in the premium smartphone market (handsets priced above $470) dropped from 59 percent in the holiday season of 2016 to 35 percent during the same period last year, Counterpoint estimates. The OnePlus 5 was the most popular premium smartphone to ship during that quarter, the research firm added. Industry watchers say Samsung and Xiaomi have benefited from offering a wide range of smartphones to customers. Samsung’s J2 lineup of smartphones, priced between $100 to $150, were the best selling handsets for the company in Q3 2017. The companies have also benefited from investments in features that address the local challenges, they added. Xiaomi’s Android-based MIUI operating system, for instance, has integration with several popular local services such as Paytm. The software also offers features to block unwanted phone calls and texts, a persistent problem that millions of Indians face. Apple’s services catalog for India, in contrast, is fairly thin and overlooks many challenges unique to the country, users say. Apple Music, an outlier among other Apple services, is perhaps the best music streaming service in India thanks to the gradual broadening of the catalog and affordable monthly fee. Several users interviewed by CNBC said they preferred Apple Music over other streaming services — but the same wasn’t true of Apple Maps and Siri. Apple Maps in India offers sparse mapping data of cities and towns, and often misses landmarks. It also lacks the basic turn-by-turn direction feature. “Apple Maps is a joke in India,” Bangalore-based Mihir Sharma, who drives on the roads of India’s Silicon Valley each day said. His experience was echoed by more than two dozen people CNBC spoke with. In the last several years, Apple has begun to acknowledge the issue and has hired hundreds of engineers at its mapping facility in Hyderabad. Services are the hooks that keep users engaged with a",error,513
3233," platform, said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester. CarPlay, Apple’s automobile infotainment system, is available on various vehicle models in India but it doesn’t offer basic navigation functionality, another user complained. Siri, Apple’s digital AI-powered assistant, is no different. It doesn’t understand many words of Indian origination and often struggles to make sense of Indian accents, users said. Apple has added support for Hindi diction and a Hinglish keyboard in the recent iOS updates, but users said it still isn’t good enough. In comparison, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, which was launched in India last year, are said to perform better in India. Amid India’s demonetization move in late 2016, which saw many international giants such as Samsung and Google launch their payment services in the country, several people waited for the launch of Apple Pay in India — to no avail. In a recent interview, Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of internet and services, said the company was still exploring the service for the country. “There is no denial that Apple ecosystem isn’t aligned much to the usage and value of Indian users. So, the services offered don’t have flavors that would entice the Indian users,” Faisal Kawoosa, an analyst with research firm CMR India said. “At the same time, the typical segment buying Apple products isn’t that typical Indian user. But, no brand can afford to underserve a segment — big or small,” he added. Apple’s strategy for India, in general, is different from other Silicon Valley giants including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft — all of which have launched specialized apps and customized several of their core services to make them work on the country’s slow and patchy networks. The Cupertino-based giant seemingly had an early advantage in India since it was one of the handful of international firms to maintain a software development team in the nation more than a decade ago. It laid off most of the staff from the development team in 2006, however, as it shifted focus to other markets. In the recent years, Apple’s opinion of India, which Cook identified as a small market for the company in 2012, has changed as the sales of iPhones slowed in Western markets. In 2016, Cook paid his maiden visit to the country as the CEO of the company.",error,513
3237," that are going to start feeling the pinch too.” What’s more, Nelsen isn’t hopeful the trade spat will be resolved anytime soon and suggests there is a role for the federal government to play to encourage consumption of American fresh fruit and vegetables both domestically and abroad. “Stimulating demand might absorb some of this product that is not going to get into China,” he said. “Apples are getting hit from all directions,” said BJ Thurlby, president of the Washington State Fruit Commission, a growers organization representing Northwest stone fruits such as cherries. Thurlby said U.S. cherries are now subject to a 50 percent import tax in China and it’s resulted in “extreme price pressure downward.” Assuming India’s tariff gets implemented, American apples also will face a substantially higher tariff than competitors, which could lead to European growers taking a slice out of the market. “There will definitely be a shift and consumers will look for substitutes or other alternatives,” Tarun Arora, director of IG International, one of India’s largest fresh fruit importers, told CNBC in an email response to a query. “The Indian consumer is very price sensitive and trade will shift in favor of European apples largely affecting overall U.S. apples supply programs in India.” According to Arora, Indian importers brought in about 8 million cartons of Washington apples this season, a banner year in terms of volume shipped. But he predicts once the tariff goes into effect, volumes could slow by 60 percent or more. Then again, some U.S. executives suggest fresh fruit producers will cut prices and sell at break-even levels in some cases just to maintain market share. This should end up hurting West Coast producers more since the going labor costs on the U.S. West Coast tend to run higher than some East Coast markets. Roughly one out of every four apples grown in the U.S. goes to the export market. The export market was valued at nearly $1 billion last year for the U.S. apple industry. “If India happens Aug. 4, almost half of all our apples that we export will be impacted in one way or another with a duty,” said Todd Fryhover, president of the Washington Apple Commission. “That’s very concerning. There’s absolutely no question about that.” Washington state is home to about 1,300 apple",error,513

Ogley said 3-D audio is something that could play a big role in the industry, given the rise of other kinds of technology that could make it an in-demand feature. “In the field of augmented and virtual reality, 3-D sound is even fundamental to the holistic experience,” he said. The Ambeo Smart Headset is available for $299.95. JLab made its name in the industry as a budget-friendly brand. Its cheapest pair of earbuds cost only $8, and its range of products have mass market appeal with distribution in megachains like Walmart and Target. On its premium end, though, JLab is incorporating the kind of technology it believes will be increasingly in demand. “When you walk around today, the world is Bluetooth,” said CEO Win Cramer. JLab’s Epic Air wireless earbuds come with a charging case and are meant to be worn during exercise. They are water-resistant enough to be “sweatproof,” and still come in $10 under Apple’s Air Pods. Even with their budget-friendly prices, it can be difficult to compete with giants like Apple. “Audio is really tertiary for those guys,” Cramer said. “We put a lot of soul into what we do, because we have to.” JLab’s Epic Air earbuds are available for $149. For start-up Como Audio, it’s all about high fidelity. Founder and CEO Tom DeVesto, who has been in the audio business for several decades, said the company is committed to making speakers for music lovers. Como’s Speakeasy model, due to be released in November, has features that tech-savvy music lovers have come to expect: It is wireless and equipped with Google Assistant. The difference between Como’s product and a typical smart speaker? “Mine’s going sound better,” DeVesto said. High-fidelity sound, though, comes at a cost. The Speakeasy is expected to start at $349, while a Google Home and Amazon Echo will run you $129 and $99.99, respectively. DeVesto knows that his audience is niche, and has priced his products accordingly. “",error,513
3245," While sales beat, iPhone unit growth of just 1 percent year over year remained lackluster, as iPhone sales upside continues to come from the reset higher in average selling price. Earnings per share beat expectations by $0.18, but we estimate that just $0.04 of the beat came from revenue upside, while the remaining $0.14 was helped by below-the-line items like higher other income, a lower tax rate, and buybacks. Given its revenue base and size, Apple’s recent growth has been impressive. However, with 80 percent of the company’s sales exposed to secularly challenged businesses, we believe the long-term growth outlook remains limited. We continue to see support for the shares from the company’s substantial share buyback, however, with positives and negatives largely balanced at current levels, we view valuation as fair and maintain our Hold.” “We believe the negativity on Apple stock is overdone and the majority of our thesis remains unchanged regarding ‘Applewood & 5 Reasons the Stock Should Trade Higher’ as detailed in this report. Specifically we highlight our view of Applewood which is Apple’s growth in service 31 percent year over year or 28 percent excluding one-time items which now represent 18 percent of Apple’s total revenues coupled with early innings growth of iPhone units in emerging markets and less than 2 percent share in India, thereby driving a growing sticky user base, which we have dubbed Applewood.” “Apple demonstrated better demand resiliency than we had expected in the summer as evidenced by an iPhone average selling price of $724 which was 5 percent ahead of our forecast. Guidance was just a touch ahead of our numbers but is consistent with our above Street average selling price estimates that are based on a detailed stock keeping unit level model. We believe Street forecasts are likely to move up but that average selling price expectations probably will remain too low for the December quarter as Apple continues to see support from ongoing mix toward higher average prices. Services growth adjusted for one offs dipped slightly but not that materially to 28 percent year over year from 31 percent last quarter.” “Five reasons why we believe Apple stock should outperform include: underlying iPhone demand remains strong and average selling prices are moving higher, gross margin has upside in fiscal 2019 given tailwinds from component cost reductions and potential tailwinds from foreign exchange, continued strong capital returns with $90 billion of buyback authorization remaining, continued strong growth in Services revenue across geographies",error,513
3245," (broad-based strength with contribution from licensing, App Store and Apple Care in the quarter), and strong demand for wearables (Apple watch grew mid 40 percent year over year and AirPods remain in high demand) drove 60 percent year over year growth.” “Yes, inventory is the highest in memory for a second calendar quarter (primarily component related, should burn completely off in CQ3) but implied iPhone units of 47 million to 48 million for CQ3 was spot in-line + services seem to be hitting an inflection. Apple is also effectively managing through some challenges on the cost side that should abate, though continued devaluation of key currencies like Chinese Yuan are an overall negative that bears watching. Given ecosystem switching which has become nearly non-existent, we think of iPhone as a recurring model in much the same way as services – albeit without much growth until there is a major form-factor change. Fortunately, this is on the horizon with foldable. In the meantime, Apple should at least hold serve with iPhone bias more to the upside based on procurement, average selling price still strong in the $720 to $725 range for the third calendar quarter, and services set to do about $3 per share in calendar 2020.” “We reiterate our Market Perform rating on Apple. June quarter results were slightly ahead of expectations; the variance vs. expectations was small enough that we expect neither bears nor bulls to change their view following this report. Apple’s rubber meets the road once the new phones come on sale, and we don’t expect the fall lineup to be different enough to improve the trajectory of iPhone sales. The Services business now represents the bull case for the stock, but our view is that it will be difficult for Apple to sustain the current rate of services growth due to a large portion tied to device sales coupled with a law of large numbers issue from App Store contribution.” “Apple reported June quarter revenue and EPS above the Street, with September-quarter revenue guidance also ahead of consensus. For the June quarter, iPhone was strong, as Apple shipped a total of 41.3 million units vs. consensus at 41.79 million and iPhone ASP was $724, compared to the Street at $694. Services revenue was $9.55 billion and gross margin was 38.3 percent. Revenue guidance for the September quarter is 3 percent above consensus, with the gross margin outlook in-line at 38.3 percent.

While Starbucks’ revenues in the Chinese market grew 17 percent, its same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, fell 2 percent. But “most of the growth of transactions in China is coming from our new store growth,” Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson told Cramer on Wednesday.  “Now, yes, we did have a negative 2 percent same-store sales comp last quarter, but, you know, if... I look at what we’re doing here with Alibaba and the digital flywheel and enabling delivery, this is like rocket fuel for the digital flywheel in China,” he said. The key to succeeding as a U.S.-based business in China? For Johnson, it’s all about embracing the culture. “The approach that we’ve taken has been one of approaching the market with humility and respect for the Chinese culture and the Chinese consumer,” he told Cramer, adding that Starbucks’ research and development teams have tinkered with some of the company’s flavor profiles to better fit the Chinese consumer. “We hire local contractors to build our stores. The store design team sits here in China,” the CEO said. “So by embracing the Chinese culture and approaching the market in the right way, you know, we believe that you can really have a very symbiotic relationship and grow a very health business like Starbucks in China by taking that approach.” Watch and read more about Johnson’s interview here.

All three iPhones will have Face ID, according to Kuo, which means you’ll unlock the iPhone by looking at it instead of using a fingerprint and a home button. All of the iPhones will run with Apple’s new iOS 12 software, which will also roll out to older iPhones. Some highlight features include Siri shortcuts, a new Do Not Disturb mode, controls that let you see how long you use certain apps, new notifications, custom Memoji and more. Apple launched a new iPad earlier this year but it hasn’t yet introduced a new version of its iPad Pro. It’s expected to launch a new version of the 12.9-inch model and a new 11-inch model this fall, possibly during the iPhone event. Code inside Apple’s new iOS 12 software suggests that Apple will remove the home button from the iPad Pro, as it did with the iPhone X and will with all of its new iPhones. That means it will support Face ID, according to Bloomberg, and will allow Apple to fit more screen on the front of the iPad, allowing it to appear to run from edge-to-edge and top-to-bottom, since the lack of a home button will allow for thinner bezels (the black areas around a display). Apple will presumably update the iPads with newer and faster processors, too, but little else has been reported about the new tablets, which means there’s some room for surprises. Bloomberg said last month that Apple is planning to release a couple of new Macs sometime this fall, so Apple might unveil them during its iPhone event. Bloomberg said Apple will launch a new affordable version of the MacBook, possibly a new MacBook Air. This is good news for fans of the MacBook Air, which has been refreshed with new processors but hasn’t seen a major design update in years. It’s unclear how Apple will price it, however, since the MacBook Air’s affordability has largely been attributed to a display that’s not as good as the more expensive MacBook and MacBook Pro Retina screens. The same report said Apple will also launch a new professional version of the Mac Mini, Apple’s small computer that ships without a display. It hasn’t typically been targeted at “pro” users, but could allow Apple to sell a powerful computer at a lower price, again since it doesn�",error,513
3289," reviews the submission, called a 510(k), before it provides clearance. A pre-market approval (PMA) is a more rigorous process and applies to higher risk medical devices. The FDA has a technical definition here. The FDA still required that Apple submit data to show that its device is sufficiently accurate and sensitive. A statement from Wednesday reads: “The FDA worked closely with the company as they developed and tested these software products, which may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly.” Apple received a de novo clearance, meaning first of its kind, which typically take a bit longer than the usual 510(k) process. AliveCor, a venture-backed company in Silicon Valley, has made the claim of being the first medical-grade EKG that’s available for consumers to buy. Those who follow the space were quick to point that out when Apple COO Jeff Williams announced on stage that Apple had a first-ever clearance for direct-to-consumer EKG monitoring. But there’s a subtle difference. Once a consumer buys an AliveCor device, they take an EKG reading (via a smartphone attachment or their Apple Watch band), and wait until a doctor unlocks it within 24 hours to get an initial reading on the app. Apple designed its system differently. The FDA cleared the company to provide these readings to consumers right away, allowing users to share the results with a physician if they choose. Apple has stressed that its business model does not support selling your personal health information to third parties, including advertisers. While the company didn’t spend a lot of time talking about privacy as it relates to the new sensor, it has made clear in the past that it will not store your health data in the cloud. Apple hasn’t said much other than later this year. Note that it’s only cleared in the U.S. You can store all the data and reports on your iPhone’s Health app. From there, you can download it and share it with a doctor. Yes. The EKG will not work if you’re moving around, and the Apple Watch will prompt you to remain at rest. No. Apple is careful with its language in referring to its device as an “intelligent health guardian.” Users can take an EKG, but if there’s any kind of abnormality, Apple recommends that you see a doctor.

Since late June, Cramer has watched shares of the top four U.S. railroads — CSX, Norfolk Southern, Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific — mount double-digit rallies. But the recent move hasn’t been performance as usual. Typically, railroad stocks tend to rally in sync with the economy, making them good litmus tests for gauging whether the economy is as strong as it seems, Cramer said. This year, however, they stalled, biding time amid report after report of strong economic news. “The fact that the rails have suddenly caught a bid is not just a big deal for this one industry, it’s a big deal for the entire market,” the “Mad Money” host said. “I think the rails are benefiting from a sense that the trade war will hurt less than many of the experts initially feared.″ What does that mean for investors? Cramer said that even after their recent run, the top four railroad stocks still look cheap, trading for anywhere between 16 and 18 times next year’s earnings estimates. “The railroad stocks are finally getting the credit they deserve now that Wall Street’s not quite so terrified by the trade war,” he said. “I think they’ve got more room to run and I think that Union Pacific is the best of the",error,513

I’m as guilty of this as anyone, but I’ve gotta tell you, I am so tired of hearing that ‘We’re now in the seventh inning of this rally,’ or ‘It’s the fourth quarter of this move for certain,’” he said. “Repeat after me: the stock market is not a baseball game. There’s no set number of innings. The game never ends, it just changes,” he continued. So, he called on commentators, analysts, bulls and bears to “lose the analogies” and instead explain what could fuel market moves and what could pose obstacles to them. “And then you let things play out. No called shots, sound-bites, no YouTube clips, but nothing to freak people out, either,” Cramer said. “In reality, lots of stocks have simply done very well over the long-haul and you would’ve missed out on some massive gains if you listened to the so-called experts who claimed we were in the seventh inning the whole way up.” In Cramer’s lightning round, he flew through his take on callers’ favorite stocks: : “Look, Chevron is a great American company. OK? And it yields almost 4 percent and you’re just going to hold onto it, alright? You’re just going to hold onto it because it’s a very well-run company. But it’s not going to run away. That’s the problem. May I suggest – those who are looking for a little more yield – you should go with.” : “It’s real low. It’s real cheap. It’s got some decent drugs in the pipeline.

It’s the device I prefer of the two, and I love reading the news or filling out a crossword on the bigger screen. The rest of the design is basically identical to the iPhone X. You have stainless steel running along the top and sides, which gives it a premium look to match the price. I love how shiny it is on the new gold and white models. Apple says the glass on the front and back is the strongest it’s ever used in a phone, and even more scratch- and shatter-resistant than the iPhone X. I’m still afraid of cracking it, as I did on a small part of my personal iPhone X, so I kept them in cases most of the time. The glass also allows you to place the phone on a wireless pad to charge it instead of plugging it in, just like with last year’s model. The camera is very good. I was impressed with the iPhone X and the Galaxy Note 9, but the iPhone XS pictures looked better to me. Apple said it upgraded the camera sensor that’s over 30 percent larger, which means it lets in more light. Also, high dynamic range (HDR) photos can be snapped twice as fast, so there isn’t the delay you see in other phones, and shadows are clearer. I also liked that I could take portrait pictures, like shots of my dog on the beach, and adjust the background blur after the fact. So a picture like this: Can also look like this: Notice how there’s more blur, or bokeh, in the second one. Previously, you couldn’t do this on an iPhone after snapping a picture. The extra 2x telephoto lens is really useful for when you want a quick zoom and can’t move in closer, and it’s a feature you won’t find in the cheaper iPhone XR. Apple improved the water-resistance of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, too, so Apple says you don’t have to worry about spilling on it, or even dropping it in a pool.

Lastly, the battery life is really good on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, but note that I’ve only been using them for a few days. My iPhone X had great battery life at first, but now seems to die long before the day is over. Apple says the iPhone XS offers 30 minutes longer battery life than its predecessor, while the iPhone XS Max offers a full 1.5 hours of additional battery life over the iPhone X. I drained the iPhone XS Max before bedtime only once during my testing, and that’s because I pretty much used it nonstop while installing apps and configuring the phone. Apple’s new iPhones run iOS 12, which is loaded with new features. Siri is improved and you can train it with a new “Siri Shortcuts” feature. It lets you do more with Siri than before, because you basically train it to answer your commands. For instance, I taught Siri to open the camera when I say “Hey Siri, say cheese.” I also used it to automatically dial in to a conference number and to automatically start a playlist and bring up directions to work. There’s also a bunch of new Animoji, which use the front-facing camera to mimic your face. And, you can create new “Memoji,” which is basically a digital cartoon version of yourself that you can send to people in messages. I had a lot of fun creating my own Memoji, which I think actually look a bit like me, unlike competing versions from Samsung. The iOS 12 also adds improvements to speed throughout the iPhone user interface. I always thought iOS was pretty fast on my iPhone X, and it’s kind of hard to notice a real difference. There are lots of other changes in iOS 12, like Screen Time that shows you how often you use some apps. That also lets you manage how long you use an app each day, in case you want to limit yourself to an hour of Facebook, for example. They work, but I don’t use them to limit my own time. Also, I love that iOS 12 gives you so much more control over notifications. You can turn off individual app notifications much easier — right",error,513
3294," from the pop-up — and even have everything grouped together so you don’t have 40 individual notifications from a single app, like News. On the same note, a new Quiet Time feature is a blessing for me, since I can silence all notifications at night, only allowing important ones — like a call from a family member — through. I don’t have too many complaints with either the iPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max. My biggest, though, is that while Apple supports faster charging, the charger in the box is insanely slow. With most Android phones, I can plug in my phone, take a shower and know that I have enough battery to get me several more hours of battery life. With the iPhone XS and iPhone XS, unless I use a bigger charger like the one included with the iPad, I don’t get that same experience. Apple told me that lots of its customers actually prefer the tiny charger to larger ones, since it’s so compact and can be carried anywhere. I’d much rather have a bulky charger that juices the phone up quicker. Still, the convenience of something like a wireless charging pad is also a nice benefit. The phones can also be awfully expensive if you want a lot of storage. The 512GB iPhone XS Max, which I had my eye on, costs more than $1,400. I just can’t swallow spending that much money, so I went with the slightly more affordable 256GB model for $1,249 when I ordered my own earlier this week. If price is a concern to you, then you really should wait to see what the iPhone XR is like. I only had a chance to spend a few minutes with it after Apple’s keynote, but it has the same processor and seems to still have a really good camera, just without things like the hardware zoom lens. It starts at $749, comes in five colors and has a 6.1-inch screen that’s larger than the iPhone XS. It’s an LCD display, like the iPhone 8 and earlier, which is still fine but just not as good at showing colors and dynamic range as an OLED screen. Look, these are the best phones Apple has made, but this was very much an “S” year, as you can tell by the modest upgrades. If you have an old iPhone, like an iPhone 7, and want the best new iPhone, you should upgrade to the XS",error,513
3316," same 12-megapixel camera as the iPhone XS, but it doesn’t have the secondary telephoto lens for clearer zoom-pictures. I was still able to take portrait mode pictures that looked really good, but only of people. The portrait mode on the iPhone XR doesn’t work with animals or still life objects, and it wasn’t able to recognize my dog when I tried. Otherwise, the pictures are still top-notch. You’re not getting some sort of watered-down camera experience. There are a few other tweaks, too. The iPhone XR has aluminum sides, instead of the more expensive polished steel on the iPhone XS. It’s still water-resistant, but not as water resistant. You can’t leave it at the bottom of the pool for a half hour, for example, but I soaked it with a hose a few times and it’s totally fine. It’ll survive a drop in the toilet without issue, and if you spill beer on it you can just rinse it under the sink. The iPhone XR looks and feels like a phone that costs more than $750. It has a premium glass and aluminum design, and I love how rich the colors look. My personal favorite is yellow, but the blue test unit I had was pretty cool, too. It felt just as fast and quick as my iPhone XS Max, which costs $1,249. Again, that’s because everything inside is the exact same. Face ID, which unlocks the phone when you look at it, is just as good as the more expensive phones, too. It unlocked almost instantly whenever I looked at the iPhone XR. And I prefer this to the old fingerprint reader hidden in the home button, which started to feel clunky by comparison. The front-facing and rear-facing cameras are great. As I mentioned above, the rear-camera is basically just as good as the iPhone XS, but portrait mode is limited to pictures of people. The front-facing camera can take portrait selfies too, though, and that worked really well. Finally, I like that it includes wireless charging, so I was able to just drop it on a charger near my bed or on my desk to top it off throughout the day. The battery life was otherwise really good, and I didn’t drain it during a regular work day once. Apple says it should offer about 1.5 hours more than last year’",error,513
3317," bezels and notch, a trend now making its way to Android phones, like Google’s Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6. While the notch and lack of bezels are considered design enhancements by many, they may not be favorable to mobile gamers who often hold the device horizontally in their hands and need to see as much of the screen as possible. Top and bottom bezels provide a place for gamers to grip the phone and help position their thumbs. “Ultimately, we did a lot of study and research and realized that actually, a square design is very comfortable. Because of the way the hand holds it, the corners don’t really affect the use case,” said Stéphane Blanchard, director of industrial design at Razer. With the square design set, the Razer team decided that the best place to put the powerful stereo front-facing speakers — an important feature for gamers — was on bezels to the left and right of the screen when held horizontally. “We have a blocky design, and we have big bezels. All combined, it is actually a great advantage because we have a great grip where we still hold the edges without covering the speakers to have great sound,” Blanchard said. With this distinctive bulky design and bezels, Razer is “bucking the trend,” said Matt Swider, a senior editor at technology news and review site TechRadar. Both the new Razer Phone 2 and its predecessor boast the best screen refresh rate of any phone, at 120Hz. High screen refresh rates provide smoother experiences and allow for potentially quicker response times helpful in fast-paced games. Apple’s iPad Pros have this feature, but even the newest iPhones are capped at 60Hz. “The difference you see in a high-refresh-rate display is not just tied to gaming. You can see it with scrolling through a web page,” said Vivek Gowri, a senior manager of hardware engineering at Razer. Recent reviews of the Razer Phone 2 say the model builds on its predecessor’s strengths as a serious contender for gamers and multimedia users, but it fails to measure up in ways that may be more important to most phone users — for example, the improved screen brightness and camera are still lacking compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Google Pixel 3. The Razer Phone’s main competition in trying to grow a gamer phone market is the Asus ROG Phone, which became available for pre-",error,513
3317,"order on Oct.18. It is the first phone released by the Taiwanese company’s Republic of Gamers (ROG) gaming hardware brand. Like the Razer, the ROG phone looks significantly different from an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, starting with a focus on how a phone should be designed when it is going to mostly be held horizontally. More from Business of Design: MIT researchers develop a chip that acts like the brain Safest homes in climate-change era are being built in shipping containers “Based on our observation, the vast majority of people game in landscape mode, so we had to think about how to accommodate the different ports,” said Vivian Lien, chief marketing officer of Asus North America and the head of global marketing for the ROG brand. Asus decided to add additional side-mounted ports that can be used for charging, docking and plugging in headphones so gamers can hold the sides of the phone more comfortably. Another new feature is the ultrasonic “AirTriggers” — extra programmable touch points on the edges of the phone screen that serve the same function as game-controller buttons when held horizontally. (Physical game controllers can be attached to the sides of the phone.) “Games require certain controls, so we started to think about what we can offer to add in the controls people are accustomed to, but without adding all the extra complexity,” Lien said. Asus is selling a variety of accessories for the phone that cost up to several hundred dollars each, including a “TwinView Dock” that adds another screen (for $399.99), a “Mobile Desktop Dock” that can connect the phone to a computer monitor in order to game with a mouse and keyboard (for $229.99). “A lot of gamers don’t game on one device only. It’s about this interoperability between their devices on the go and the device they use primarily in a stationary environment,” Lien said. “The ability to control their own gaming experience is one of the most appealing things about the ROG phone.” These gaming phones are also differentiating themselves from Apple and Samsung with better cooling mechanisms and bigger batteries to allow prolonged playing time. “The ability to not overheat is really crucial to having a good gaming phone,” Swider said. “That is how Razer and other phone makers can rival an iPhone or a Samsung phone that obviously has more mainstream appeal right now.”",error,513
3317," The Razer and ROG phones both use custom vapor chamber cooling technology to disperse heat from the chipset and sustain performance, with Razer adapting the thermal system used in its gaming laptops. Asus is even including an external “AeroActive Cooler” accessory that mounts on the side port. For all their gaming-optimized features, these devices still need to handle all the regular smartphone needs as users carry them around, in order to gain any traction in the competitive phone market. Razer incorporated feedback from its first phone to make the second generation more viable as a daily driver, including significantly improving the camera — a point of much criticism in the predecessor, brightening the screen for better outdoor use and adding wireless charging, an increasingly common mainstream feature. But the gaming designs come at a cost in terms of bulkiness. “These are not thin and light gaming phones,” Swider said. “They are akin to gaming laptops, whereas the iPhone is more like a thin MacBook Air.” Asus isn’t shy about marketing to the high-end gamer segment of the market and betting that these consumers will pay significantly more for accessories. “The phone still functions perfectly like a phone, but we wanted to be known as a gaming phone and not as an all-purpose phone that also does gaming,” Lien said. The price point of the Razer and Asus ROG phones will create pressure from both above and below, according to Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. The Razer Phone 2 starts at $799 — $100 more than its predecessor — while the ROG Phone starts at $899, with the cooling accessory included. Both will have more expensive versions with extra storage available. These prices are comparable with Apple and Android flagship phones, many of which have the same top line processor in the most recent models. The phone market’s lower tier now includes models optimized for gaming with sufficient frame rates and audio quality and large displays. “These devices will not offer the most optimal gaming experience, but more importantly, they come in around $300 and can play games like PUBG, Honor of Kings, Doupo Cangqiong, Pokémon GO, etc., smoothly enough,” Fieldhack said via email. The popularity of Chinese technology giant Tencent’s Honor of Kings, which has an estimated 200 million monthly players, and other mobile games have also fueled the rise of gaming phones from Chinese manufacturers around this price point, though few are available outside",error,513

Knowing the difference between real, federally-approved medicine and alternative treatments is key when it comes to cannabis, says  CEO Justin Gover, whose company’s cannabis-based epilepsy treatment launched Thursday in the United States. “We think it’s’ really important to distinguish between what is medicine and what is not,” Gover told Cramer in an interview, responding to a question about whether Canadian marijuana producers should label themselves as “medical” marijuana companies. ″[The Food and Drug Administration] make[s] that determination, and where there are products that don’t meet FDA standards and have not been approved by [the] FDA, we don’t believe that they should be appropriately termed as medications,” Gover said on “Mad Money.” Click here to watch and read more about his interview. Enterprise security player Proofpoint has “a greater opportunity than ever before” as cyber-threats become more intense and multifaceted, Proofpoint Chairman and CEO Gary Steele told Cramer in a Thursday interview. Proofpoint’s continued success “comes down to two things,” the CEO said: ”[the] threat landscape continues to get more complicated, more malicious, and the fact that more organizations are moving to the cloud.” Steele pointed to a list of recommendations released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which the SEC warned companies to evaluate how they deal with phishing scams and email fraud. “We, again, think this is an important notification and catalyst for further business for us,” he told Cramer. “The threat landscape continues to shift.

But if you ask Ferriola, a strong economy, higher demand and stable end markets far overshadow the tariffs’ effects on his company’s business.

Cramer is growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes won’t fix with the problems they are intended to solve. “This earnings season, we’ve heard company after company cite rising costs: higher ethane prices thanks to a freak spike in natural gas, higher steel costs because of the tariffs, higher freight costs because we have a shortage of truck drivers,” the “Mad Money” host said. “The Fed wants to tighten in order to stamp out all of this inflation, but higher interest rates won’t actually solve many of these problems.” In reality, if companies think that the business cycle could be peaking, they’ll stop expanding operations when price increases stop sticking and inventory piles up, Cramer said. “Sure, the Fed can accelerate this process, but do we really need them to turn a mild slowdown into a worse slowdown? Honestly, the trade war with China is already doing that job,” he said. RingCentral has been compared with Broadsoft, the communications software provider acquired by Cisco, but RingCentral is actually taking business away from Cisco, RingCentral’s chief told Cramer on Tuesday. “We’re winning business from them all the time,” RingCentral’s founder, Chairman and CEO Vlad Shmunis said in an exclusive interview. “The No. 1 provider or company that we replace happens to be Cisco, followed by Avaya.” A cloud-based telecom player focused on modernizing internal and customer-facing communication for enterprises, RingCentral is “in the lead” of its $100 billion addressable market, Shmunis said. “All of the legacy providers are in secular decline,” he said",error,513

The 50 percent retracement from 2,603 to 2815 was 2700ish,” said Redler. Mark Newton, chief technical analyst at Greywolf Execution Partners, said tech could decide the market’s fate. “If Apple is still trending down, there is no evidence of bottoming. We should not be surprised. The stock, like other techs, is still trending lower,” he said, adding longer term trends are still positive. The S&P levels Newton is watching are 2,711 and then 2,709. “If that breaks, it calls for a much deeper retracement,” he said. “If we get under that it’s going to be a legitimate retest, which is truly going to bring out a lot of fear.” Newton said if more fear comes in that could set the stage for a seasonal bounce in the market. “I don’t think we could say with a lot of confidence, there needs to be this year end rally, and now everyone is looking for it. They’re scratching thier heads. It doesn’t seem to be fear. It’s confusion, and when confusion turns to fear that’s when you see a trading low,” he said. How Apple trades over the next several days will be key for the market, and the way the market trades will be a factor in deciding how it trades into next year. “That’s a wild card.

I’ve always been able to easily fly across the country and watch movies on my 10.5-inch iPad Pro without hitting the battery too hard. My iPad Pro lasted from Friday evening until Monday morning, and still had 39 percent charge remaining. I used it for writing, light gaming, watching some movies and chatting with friends. If you want to really use the iPad as a laptop, however, you need to buy a keyboard. Apple sells one for $179, so I bought one for the review. I’m impressed that I was able to type pretty efficiently on it. While the keys felt good for typing, the rest of the case felt and looked really cheap. That’s a bummer considering the price. I’d skip it altogether look for a third-party option from a company like Logitech. Likewise, there’s a new Apple Pencil 2 stylus that attaches with magnets to the side of the iPad where it can charge. That’s much better than having to plug the pencil in to a Lightning port, which was Apple’s solution on previous iPad Pro models. The Pencil 2 performed awfully similar to the original Apple Pencil, but I liked that I could automatically switch between tools, like the eraser and a writing pen, by tapping the side of the Apple Pencil. Despite what Apple has said time and time again, I can’t actually do work on the iPad Pro, which means it didn’t replace my work laptop at all. Part of this is because iOS has barely changed over the past couple of years, and it doesn’t support apps that I need to use for work. Apple likes to suggest the iPad Pro is good at multitasking, but it’s not close to what you can do on a traditional computer. Even when I’m writing outside of our work system on the iPad, I hate that I have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open another app. I appreciate that I can run two apps side by side, but I liked windowed applications such as on a Mac or Windows computer, where I can quickly move between apps without having to swipe around on a display.

Huawei has historically had a business-to-business focus and this often meant Yu clashed with senior management as he tried to push the consumer business. “The big challenge for me is I’m working for a company, the whole company runs on B2B, our managers, all our guys, executives, are B2B heads, but with this B2B head we are running a B2C business. So there are a lot of arguments, a lot of obstacles because people say, ‘you are doing this the wrong way.’ Actually we are doing this the right way. This is the biggest barrier,” Yu said in a very frank part of the interview. Still, Huawei has pushed ahead with consumer products. Much of its success so far has been down to putting out smartphones with new technologies but at affordable price points. It has been pushing the barrier with prices and also bringing in cutting-edge features. For example, the P20 Pro was launched earlier this year, boasting a triple-lens camera that retailed for just over $1,000. Huawei also designs its own artificial intelligence chips which appear in its smartphones, much like Apple does. For Yu, AI will be a key technology that will take smartphones to the next level and help the company grow in the future. “AI is coming. AI will be the engine for all the future services. AI will be elementary to working on many devices, it will connect all the apps, you can get all the services from this AI capability. The biggest changes in the next 10 years will be AI-enabled phones capability,” Yu told CNBC. Huawei is working on a foldable phone which will debut next year and be the company’s first 5G-enabled handset. Yu also told CNBC that augmented reality (AR) glasses are also in the works. The Chinese technology giant has not been afraid to jump into new consumer products including laptops and smart speakers. These new technologies could provide a growth engine for Huawei going forward. But Huawei sees its future beyond hardware too. The company has services such as cloud storage, music streaming and video content, which are little known outside of China. It’s something the company doesn’t talk much about but",error,513
3350," it claims Huawei Music, its music streaming platform, has 100 million monthly active users. For comparison, Spotify has 191 million. Services have been a traditionally tough aspect of the business to crack for purely hardware players. While Apple has managed to create a multi-billion dollar business out of software and services — mainly because it owns the operating system that iPhones run on — rivals like Samsung have struggled because they rely on Google’s Android. For Huawei, it will be a tough battle, especially if it looks to internationalize any services, given the strength of companies like Spotify and Netflix outside China. “Currently Huawei is primarily synonymous with being a hardware provider and it may find it needs to get its brand more established in consumer consciousness before it can make the transition to offering services too,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email. “With so many well-recognized services such as Spotify for music and Netflix for films and TV already established with such a large number of consumers, it is doubly difficult for Huawei to grab share in these areas,” he added. “However, history shows that Huawei can be incredibly tenacious so I would not rule out the company slowly getting consumers outside China to embrace its service over time. That said, it’s going to be a long tough journey,” Wood said. Huawei faces some headwinds in its global ambitions. The company has been caught up in politics over the past few years with its consumer division being dragged into it as well. In 2012, Huawei was effectively blocked from the U.S. network equipment market after the government cited it as a national security risk that could provide backdoor access to leak sensitive information to China. The company denies this claim. Earlier this year, six top U.S. intelligence officials warned American consumers not to buy Huawei phones. Yu addressed the tough conditions in the U.S., saying it’s not necessary to be in the market in order to grow. “China and U.S. trade war is creating a higher barrier for us. Because the consumer business is so big, I think we can focus on other market rather than U.S. market,” he said. “The market is so big, we don’t need to wait for the U.S. market. Instead we can put more energy on the global market,” Yu said, adding that Huawei hopes to return to the U.S. but will “have to",error,513

The move to streaming services could also benefit the band’s DGM Live website, which sells the group’s independently-released music and merchandise. A newly-available streaming catalog could open up customer bases for it in new, far-flung places. “Classic rock has a significant following in the Asia region, which is often ignored during tours,” said Mangala Bhattacharjee of the India-based market intelligence firm Research on Global Markets. “Moving to streaming services not only gives bands exposure in newer markets, but also the opportunity to grow their business through online sales and subscriptions.” Perhaps most importantly, the DGM Live website is home to a vast archive of live recordings dating back to the group’s first concert in 1969. These downloadable “official bootlegs” number in the hundreds and sell for $10 each, and according to attorney Donald E. Petersen, they may be the band’s most important long-term asset. “The live recordings are infinitely more valuable to [the group], and leasing studio recordings to Apple Music will help grow the market for the band’s full catalog,” he said. The group may also be making this move simply because the passage of time demands it. Some of its members are now in their 70s, as are many of their longtime fans, and Tara Anne, an artist manager who has worked with such musicians as Snoop Dogg and the Indigo Girls, said that King Crimson and other legacy artists must embrace streaming as a matter of survival. “If the majority of your fanbase is aging and you are hoping to continue to introduce a younger audience to your music, you make the move to digital,” she said. Jeff Price, CEO and Founder of the digital rights service Audiam, agreed, and said that artists without a presence on Apple Music, Spotify and other streaming services are putting themselves at a disadvantage that could prove commercially fatal. “People 30 years and younger all predominantly use streaming services,” he said. “If you want to fade into obscurity, there is no better path than to ensure your music is not where the ‘kids’ are today.” Finally, David Singleton said that putting King Crimson’s catalog",error,513

To charge them, just drop the headphones in the batter case to get up to 24 more hours of battery life. That’s more than I think most people need. Dropping the buds in the case also gives you 1.5 hours of battery life after just 5 minutes, which is convenient if you have dead headphones and need some extra juice in a pinch. Call quality was also good. My wife said I sounded like I was on a headset, and that the call was still really clear. I was also able to walk pretty far from my phone, about 100 feet down a hallway, before the call started to cut in and out. Finally, I liked that I could say “Hey Siri,” and ask Apple’s voice assistant the weather or to play music. The headphones seemed to understand me well, but there’s also a dedicated button on each earbud that you can hold and press to access Siri. You can also tap either button to play and pause music. I found this more convenient than tapping the sides of AirPods, which have the same function but don’t have buttons. My biggest problem with the Powerbeats Pro is that the charging case is huge compared with the one you get for AirPods. You could jam it into your pocket, sure, but it would look awfully silly. It’s best for keeping in purses and backpacks. That’s not as convenient as AirPods, which I always have in my pocket. They’re so discrete I often forget I even have my AirPods with me. They’re also expensive. The new AirPods start at $159, but cost $199 if you want the wireless charging case. The Powerbeats Pro cost $249 and don’t have wireless charging. That means, unlike the new AirPods, you can’t just drop the case on a wireless charging pad that you might also use with your iPhone to power it up. This isn’t a deal breaker.

This is critical as TGT is now lapping 100-150 bps of TRU benefit. Stepping back, TGT’s 4.8% comp is one of the best so far in large cap retail’s 1Q (HD 3.0%, LOW 4.2%, WMT 3.4%, TJX 5.0%). As we’ve been saying since last fall, we prefer share gainers in light of our constrained view of the consumer in 2019 (see 2019 Smells Like Late Cycle and Share of Wallet deep dive). (3) The inflection in margin is real with the GM dilution per unit of ecommerce growth improving and cost control remains strong, which biases margins and valuation to the upside.” Read more about this call here. Citi said the large cap bio tech companies, Amgen & Gilead,  are going back to “stability/growth.” “1) We think investors should look at large caps again as some of them are returning back to stability/growth; 2) we do not favor large, late-stage M&As for growth as their utility in inducing biotech growth is debatable; 3) we favor early-stage",error,513

However we think it is in the valuations and large biotechs are more disciplined on price and less reliant on price increases.” New Street said that although there may be bumps along the way, that Uber is a “great asset.” “We are confident Uber can quadruple bookings by 2025, driving margins as a percentage of bookings towards 7%. We use that forecast to set our $50 price target. It reflects uber trading on 20x Ebit in 2020, and also corresponds to 0.8x 2021 bookings, in line with Amazon’s trading range in 2005-2015. In the near term, the ride may be rocky. the KPI we will care the most about will be user growth, and should do well, while ride per user, ARPU, and take rate will drift down for another couple of years. At the same time quarterly performance may be lumpy as Uber invests in stabilizing local competitive landscapes. This will likely create some volatility, and we recommend investors to build positions over time, and for the long run.” Evercore said Ferrari has an “impressive” earnings cadence. “In this turbulent period of declining sales/production, and with arguably the largest event risk the auto industry has faced this millennium sitting only months away (EU CO2 regs), we urge investors to seek solace (or “Hide”) in Ferrari’s impressive earnings cadence (+12% EPS CAGR out to 2022), unrivaled pricing power, and unique ability to control its own destiny. We U/G RACE to Outperform and increase our PT to $155 (from $137).” Citi upgraded Booking Holdings saying that valuation “better reflects” the slowdown of the business. “Factors supporting our BKNG upgrade include the following: 1) With BKNG’s underperformance over the last year, the valuation now better reflects the business’ slowdown and is now attractive on a cash flow basis (e.g., 5-6% FCF yield). BKNG is currently trading at the low end of its historical EV/",error,513

The value of the Canadian business at ~$7bn, according to our estimates, is more than the liability ascribed to it ($2.4bn). This offsets the poor quality of constant currency earnings, which we have estimated boosts EPS by 2% (1% due to removal of transaction currency impact, 1% due to structural translation FX). PMI’s Canadian subsidiary value is more that the value of the liability, unlike BATS.

For Comcast, the pivot from primarily a video distributor to a connectivity company has been fairly smooth. Comcast’s strong broadband gains underscore the company’s successful pivot to broadband, providing expanding margins and lower capital intensity. The Wireless business is showing steady gains, and NBCU continues to operate at a very high level. Comcast’s best-in-class uFCF yield further supports our upside case for the shares. Upgrade to BUY, PT to $52.” Stephens said it likes Zynga’s management and is bullish on the company’s new game launches. “Under Frank Gibeau, Zynga has had a three-pronged approach to growth, 1) live services, 2) new game launches, 3) M&A. We feel significantly more confident in each one of these areas now than we did when we launched equal-weight in January. With the stock up 57% ytd, one could point out that the market agrees with this view. In order to make sure that we are not too late to the story, we decided to reunderwrite Zynga by valuing each of the above areas separately. In our view, this “sum-of-the-parts” analysis shows that at the current price, the risk/reward is highly skewed to the upside and you are getting a nearly free call option on the company’s robust new game slate and likely accretive M&A.” Deutsche Bank said the company has margins “below” some of its peers. “Our 2020E EV/EBITDA based valuation is $9/sh (using 5.0x EV/EBITDA vs the past 15 year average of 5.5x) and our DCF based valuation is $13/sh (using a discount rate of 9.0%). Using a 50/50 blend of the two valuations results in a PT of $11/sh and an implied 17% downside to the current share price. While the share price has already retreated from recent highs, we are concerned that ND/EBITDA increases to a peak of 4.5x on our forecasts (higher than 4x indicated as comfortable by the management, and well above 1.3x in",error,513
3370," 2018), the company longer term still has margins below some peers on our forecasts and in an overall steel market lacking discipline, we believe X’s share price will remain under pressure. By 2023, X still has the lowest FCF Yield of our 7 stocks under coverage as well as the highest Capex/EBITDA ratio. The company is committing to large scale projects that once started will be hard to back out of.” Deutsche said the steel maker’s fundamentals are “deteriorating.” “Our 2020E EV/EBITDA based valuation is $46/sh (using 6.5x EV/EBITDA vs the past 15 year average of 6.8x) and our DCF based valuation is $60/sh (using a discount rate of 8.0%). Using a 50/50 blend of the two valuations results in a PT of $53/sh and an implied 4% upside to the current share price. NUE has outperformed its closest peer STLD (-14% vs -26% the past 6 months vs. S&P500′s +5%) with some differences in product sales mix (e.g. NUE has more plate exposure which has been a relatively better performing market). Despite its heavy capital spending (spread over 10 projects in total -$3.5bn capex with $2.9bn over 2019-22), the company is forecasted to generate excess cash, thereby able to maintain its dividend and deliver modest buybacks and the company can therefore maintain a relatively flat ND/EBITDA profile overall. By splitting capex across a large number of projects the company can manage timing/balance sheet moves/capital management. However with market sentiment likely to be negative for sometime and fundamentals deteriorating we believe the stock could be rangebound for sometime.” Bank of America downgraded the stock after the company’s earnings saying it saw a slowing of “revenue growth” in the U.S. “We are downgrading Canada Goose to Neutral (from Buy) and lowering our PO to C$54/US$40 (from C$93/US$70) based on 25X our F2021 EPS of $2.15 (rolling forward our valuation base to F21 from F20) as we believe an outlook for slowing momentum in GOOS’ Direct-to-Consumer channel warrants a lower P/E multiple. GOOS reported F4Q19 adjusted EPS",error,513

In addition, U.S. revenue growth slowed to just+6%, a significant deceleration from 40%+ growth the last 2Q’s despite an additional company owned store on top of 3 U.S. stores last year.” Bank of America called the ongoing litigation, an “overhang.” “We are downgrading TEVA to Underperform (from Buy) for three reasons: 1) legal exposure – TEVA has exposure to various ongoing opioid litigation. Though we are not legal advisers, we believe TEVA has credible defenses in the opioid suits, but financial downside is difficult to bracket. While this has been a known risk factor for months, the recent sector de-rating indicates to us a definitive ‘clearing event’ is needed for the stock to work. However, the highly fragmented nature of opioid lawsuits creates an impediment for a global master settlement. While the majority of cases have been consolidated in the multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding, only track 1 (Ohio cases) could yield a binding ruling (potentially 1H20) the rest of cases could extend to 2021+; 2) updated valuation – our updated DCF valuation of $9/shr includes $3.5bn in present value ($5.1bn gross) for potential litigation exposure from separate opioid and price fixing lawsuits still reflects a one-turn premium (EV/EBITDA) vs. levered, distressed spec pharma peers; 3) catalysts – lack of upside for key brands and US generic pipeline that is interesting but insufficient upside optionality. Our new PO is now predicated on DCF (was EV/EBITDA).” Raymond James said the homebuilder has experienced a “greater degree of pricing pressure” than the firm realized. “We are lowering our rating on Toll Brothers to Market Perform (from Outperform) following a review of last week’s F2Q19 results, which leaves us concerned that reduced estimates, a lack of upcoming catalysts, and lingering West Coast issues will leave shares range-bound near term",error,513
3370,". Unfortunately, a greater degree of pricing pressure than we expected has emerged in TOL’s markets, leading to higher selling incentives and reduced FY19 gross margin guidance. Also, our updated analysis of re-sale market conditions suggests that heightened y/y re-sale inventory at TOL’s price points will remain a lingering issue this summer, most noticeably in California, Seattle, and Dallas. Moreover, with added construction delays, we find TOL’s new guidance projecting FY19 operating results well below our prior expectations and implying a deteriorating level of forward ROIC and ROE (now just 9% and 11%, respectively). TOL’s current valuation still remains intriguing on both an absolute and relative basis (1.1x/1.3x GAAP/adjusted book value vs. 1.6x peer average). However, we feel until TOL can demonstrate margin stability and re-accelerating ROIC metrics, TOL will remain a “show-me” story.” Credit Suisse lowered it’s price target on Kraft Heinz due to the ongoing SEC investigation. “We are lowering our TP to $26 from $33 and our forward estimates on KHC below management guidance due to the possibility that the SEC’s investigation into the company will continue to reveal breakdowns in the company’s internal controls and negatively impact the company’s forward outlook. There is also significant uncertainty related to potential dilution from divestitures and reinvestment needs. We are lowering our FY19 and FY20 EPS well below consensus to $2.68 (from $2.80) and $2.61 (from $2.85).” BMO said the medical device company has the “richest pipeline” in its coverage. “We are adding BSX to our Top Picks list, joining PODD and WMGI, and increasing our target to $46 from $44 (based on 24-25x 2020E EPS or a $44-46 range). BSX weathered a 1Q19 miss and the reset of its 2019 guidance, yet there are several upcoming catalysts including: 1) the FDA Paclitaxel Panel (June 19/20), 2) its June 26 Analyst meeting (and pipeline update), and 3) the close of BTG (mid-2019E).

Evercore reversed its earlier upgrade of the stock after Fiat Chrysler withdrew its merger proposal. “We had upgraded both FCA in Renault to Outperform on May 28 based on three core components: 1. Upside to FCA Core Value – Increased clarity/an answer to the long questioned technology path forward/scale for FCA in EU. 2. RNO Core value – Closing of the negative stub gap. 3. Synergies – ~10% accretive even assuming a -35% discount. Originally we saw a VERY high chance of a merger happening. Even though FCA’s retreat doesn’t necessarily mean that a merger is completely off the table, the likelihood of it happening has materially fallen. Consequently, we are moving back to old recommendations and updating Price Targets for current negative macro (poor production, Mexico, EU 232, EU CO2, China): for FCA (In-Line; TP €11) and Renault (In-Line; TP €50). For both companies this implies ~5x 2019E earnings.” “We’re downgrading TRV’s shares to Market Perform from Outperform; YTD, the shares have returned 25.9% versus the S&P 500′s 12.7% return, and are now just over 2% below our unchanged $153 target price. We’re nudging down our 2019E/2020E EPS to $11.35/$11.70 from $11.40/$11.75 (reflecting QTD adverse weather and declining interest rates), and introducing our initial 2021E EPS of $12.45.” Stifel said Canopy represents the best investable opportunity among its peers to capitalize on growth in the industry. “We are initiating coverage of Canopy Growth with a Buy rating and target price of C$64 which we derive by assigning a 12x EV/Sales multiple to our FY21 sales estimate of C$ 1.6 billion.

We are positive on EA due to the company’s strong competitive advantages in its key sports franchises, its ongoing IP diversification (licensed vs. owned), and its robust pipeline.” Goldman Sachs said the airline has one of the “highest levels” of upside potential in its coverage world. “Expect UAL shares to appreciate on current forecast, but see further upside risk if a new credit card agreement is reached; Upgrading to Buy from Neutral. Given UAL’s share price decline since we initiated in November 2018, it now has one of the highest levels of upside potential to our price target in our coverage universe. We believe that the company’s more difficult second half 2019 unit revenue comparables, investor concerns around its loan to Avianca, and its relatively larger exposure to China have weighed on shares. We think that the more difficult second half comparables are appropriately incorporated into our forecast and consensus forecasts and believe that the potential downside risks associated with China and Avianca are priced in at these levels.

3376,", then it’s hard to make the case that consumers are harmed by tech’s low prices. But Delrahim takes a different perspective. “The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition,” he said. “Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low. It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.” In addition to price inflation, “diminished quality is also a type of harm to competition,” Delrahim said. “As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection.” Similar to how competing companies can drive down each others’ prices, competition can also encourage companies to include quality elements such as privacy features. This concept could become particularly important for companies like Facebook and Google, which don’t charge consumers for their services but collect vasts amount of data about them. Apple, on the other hand, has tried to preempt this approach by emphasizing consumer privacy in its products. Delrahim said the concept regulating companies outside of price competition would not be a new approach. During the peak of Standard Oil’s dominance, he said, consumers saw lower prices. “This was likely due to, among other things, a combination of economies of scale, superior bargaining power, and overall declining input prices,” he said. “It nonetheless demonstrates that price effects are not the sole measure of harm to competition under the U.S. antitrust laws.” Delrhaim said exclusivity is another important way to evaluate anti-competitive behavior. “Generally speaking, an exclusivity agreement is an agreement in which a firm requires its customers to buy exclusively from it, or its suppliers to sell exclusively to it. There are variations of this restraint, such as requirements contracts or volume discounts,” he said. While exclusivity is not inherently anti-competitive, according to Delrahim, there are cases where a company may use exclusivity “to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition.” He referenced the antitrust case against Microsoft, which focused in part on the company’s inclusion of its web browser in its Windows operating system, which he said discouraged users from uninstalling it and seeking alternatives. “",error,513
3376,"This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim said. Apple has faced criticism and legal action for its rules around its App Store, which comes preinstalled on iPhones and provides specific rules to developers who wish to distribute their apps through the system. The Supreme Court recently ruled that consumers have standing to sue the company in a case arguing its commission on app sales has inflated prices for the software. Anticompetitive behavior can also stifle innovation, according to Delrahim. He described how acquisitions of young competitors could be considered anticompetitive. “They can be beneficial to the extent they combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise,” Delrahim said.  “It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality. Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.” Facebook notably raised antitrust concerns when it announced plans to buy another social networking platform, Instagram, and later, WhatsApp. At the time that Facebook announced the Instagram deal in 2012, Social Internet Fund Founder Lou Kerner told the Associated Press the $1 billion price tag on the young company was “astronomical.” But even at the time, he recognized the deal kept Instagram “out of the hand of competitors.” Today, $1 billion seems like a steal for Facebook, which analysts have estimated is now worth about $100 billion, according to Bloomberg. Instagram is the most popular social network among teens, according to a Piper Jaffray survey. Facebook also likely benefits from the fact that most Americans don’t know it owns Instagram, according to a recent survey by DuckDuckGo. The rise of a handful of tech giants also prevents smaller firms, like a young Instagram, from having ample leverage in acquisitions, Delrahim noted. “Interestingly, independent companies complained that the commitment prevented them from selling out on advantageous terms with AT&T,” Delrahim said, referencing the historical antitrust case. “Indeed, this complaint is evocative of start-ups for whom a popular exit strategy is acquisition by a large firm in the same or an adjacent market.” Delrahim said the Antitrust Division could look into �",error,513

While we appreciate this risk, we believe Dell can consistently deleverage its balance sheet through a wide array of cash-generating actions, while also poten-tially benefiting from refinancing opportunities given the possibility of lower inter-est rates; 3) We have confidence in Dell’s progression towards its 12% operating-margin target, driven by an improvement in Storage and higher VMware mix; 4) We believe the recent pullback in Dell’s share price and resulting valuation offers down-side protection.” D.A. Davidson said “recent” company headwinds are largely in the mirror. “We are initiating coverage of Hostess Brands with a BUY rating and $16 price target. We think recent headwinds (leadership turnover, dilutive M&A, mix pressures, and lower mass channel promotional support) are now largely behind the company, setting up achievable expectations (guidance & consensus) over the next two years.” Piper said the chocolate maker has stable growth but is trading at a historically high premium to its peers. “Hershey has a US-centric portfolio with generally stable top-line and earnings growth, but valuation now looks inconsistent with consensus expectations. It now trades at a historically high premium relative to US consumer peers, despite consensus EPS growth expectations that are more in-line with peers. Notably, HSY shares trade at a 70% premium to K shares even though Hershey’s consensus EPS growth outlook is in-line with Kellogg’s. We also do a reverse DCF analysis that suggests 3% implied market expectations for Hershey’s topline growth, more than twice its 1.3% consensus sales growth expectations for 2020-21. We maintain our 2019E/20E EPS of $5.70/$6.00 and raise our target to $125 (based on a higher multiple of ~21x our 2020E EPS of $6.00) to recognize better market sentiment for defensive stocks, but lower our rating to UW.” Wolfe initiated coverage on the stock and said it has a “more bullish view on the Disney versus Netflix debate.” “We initiate NFLX with an Outperform and $442 PT.",error,513

Citi said it sees too “lofty” second half expectations for the networking & cybersecurity solutions provider. “We are downgrading Juniper from Neutral to Sell and lowering our target price from $28 to $24. We have picked up recent competitive share gains by Arista and Cisco and this sets up for more share loss to Juniper and too lofty 2H expectations. Accordingly, we are lowering our 2H financial projections.” Goldman said that it sees earnings risks “increasing” for the company that specializes in application services and delivery networking. “Even though FFIV is trading near the bottom of its 3-year PE range (12X-19X) we believe that earnings risks are increasing due to the weaker short-term spending environment and increasing competitive threat. Enterprise represents ~65% of F5′s revenue and short term indications for spending in that market have been weak.” J.P.
